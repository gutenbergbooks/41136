<h2 class="chap1">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="s08">FORTUNE'S BALL</span></h2>

<p>I was born a month after my father's death, and my
mother called me after him. His name was John
Westenra Wickham, but I was Westenra Wickham
alone. It was a strange name for a girl, and as I grew
up people used to comment on it. Mother loved it
very much, and always pronounced it slowly. She
was devoted to father, and never spoke of him as
most people do of their dead, but as if he were still
living, and close to her and to me. When a very
little child, my greatest treat was to sit on her knee
and listen to wonderful stories of my brave and
gallant father. He was a handsome man and a
good man, and he must have possessed, in a large
degree, those qualities which endear people to their
fellows, for surely it was no light cause which made
my mother's beautiful brown eyes sparkle as they
did when she spoke of him, and her whole face
awake to the tenderest life and love and beauty
when she mentioned his name.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>

<p>I grew up, therefore, with a great passionate
affection for my dead father, and a great pride in
his memory. He had been a Major-General in a
Lancer regiment, and had fought many battles for
his country, and led his men through untold dangers,
and performed himself more gallant feats than I
could count. He received his fatal wound at last in
rescuing a brother-officer under fire in Zululand, and
one of the last things he was told was that he had
received his Victoria Cross.</p>

<p>During my father's lifetime mother and he
were well off, and for some years after his death
there did not appear to be any lack of money. I
was well educated, partly in Paris and partly in
London, and we had a pretty house in Mayfair, and
when I was eighteen I was presented to Her Gracious
Majesty by mother's special friend, and my godmother,
the Duchess of Wilmot, and afterwards I
went a great deal into society, and enjoyed myself
as much as most girls who are spirited and happy
and have kind friends are likely to do. I was quite
one and twenty before the collapse came which
changed everything. I don't know how, and I
don't know why, but our gold vanished like a
dream, and we found ourselves almost penniless.</p>

<p>"Now what are we to do, Westenra?" said mother.</p>

<p>"But have we nothing?" I replied.</p>

<p>"Only my pension as your dear father's widow.
Your pension as his child ceased when you came of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
age, and I believe, for so our lawyers tell me, that
there is about fifty pounds besides. I think we can
count on a hundred and fifty a year. Can we live
on that sum, Westenra?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered proudly.</p>

<p>I was standing behind one of the silk curtains in
the drawing-room as I spoke. I was looking down
into the street. The room was full of luxury, and
the people who passed backwards and forwards in
their luxurious carriages in the street below were
many of them our friends, and all more or less
moved in what was called nice society. I was full of
quite unholy pride at that moment, and poverty was
extremely distasteful, and to live on a hundred and
fifty pounds a year seemed more than impossible.</p>

<p>"What is it, West? What are you thinking
of?" said mother, in a sad voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, too many things to utter," I replied. "We
can't live on the sum you mention. Why, a
curate's wife could scarcely manage on it."</p>

<p>"Don't you think we might just contrive in a
very small cottage in the country?" pleaded mother.
"I don't want much, just flowers round me and the
country air, and your company, darling, and&mdash;and&mdash;oh,
very small rooms would do, and the furniture of
this house is ours. We could sell most of it, and
send what we liked best down to the cottage."</p>

<p>"It can't be done," I answered. "Listen, mother,
I have a proposal to make."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it, my darling? Don't stand so far
away&mdash;come and sit near me."</p>

<p>I walked gravely across the room, but I did not
sit down. I stood before mother with my hands
tightly locked together, and my eyes fastened on
her dear, lovely, delicate old face.</p>

<p>"I am glad that the furniture is ours," I began.</p>

<p>"Of course it is."</p>

<p>"It is excellent furniture," I continued, looking
round and appraising it quickly in my mind's eye:
"it shall be part of our capital."</p>

<p>"My dear child, our capital? What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"We will take a house in Bloomsbury, put the
furniture in, and have paying guests."</p>

<p>"West, are you mad? Do you remember who I
am&mdash;Mrs. Wickham, the widow of&mdash;or no, I never
will allow that word&mdash;the wife of your dear, dear,
noble father."</p>

<p>"Father would approve of this," I answered.
"He was a brave man and died fighting, just as
I mean to die fighting. You are shocked at the
idea to-night, mother, because it is fresh to you,
but in a week's time you will grow accustomed
to it, you will take an interest in it, you will
even like it. I, bury myself in the country and
starve!&mdash;no, no, no, I could not do it. Mother,
darling, I am your slave, your devoted slave, your
own most loving girl, but don't, don't ask me to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
vegetate in the country. It would kill me&mdash;it would
kill me."</p>

<p>I had dropped on my knees now and taken both
her hands in mine, and I spoke with great excitement,
and even passion.</p>

<p>"Don't stir for a moment," said mother; "how
like your father you look! Just the same eyes,
and that straight sort of forehead, and the same
expression round your lips. If your father were
alive he would love you for being brave."</p>

<p>As mother looked at me I think she forgot for
the moment the terrible plunge we were about to
make into the work-a-day strata of society, but the
next instant the horrid fact was brought back to
her, for Paul, our pretty little page, brought in a
sheaf of letters on a salver. Of course they were
unpaid bills. Mother said sadly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Put them with the others, Westenra."</p>

<p>"All these bills must be met," I said stoutly,
after Paul had closed the door behind him. "There
will be just enough money for that purpose, so we
need not start handicapped. For my part, I mean
to enjoy our scheme vastly."</p>

<p>"But, my child, you do not realise&mdash;you will be
stepping down from the position in which you were
born. Our friends will have nothing to do with us."</p>

<p>"If they wish to give us up because we do something
plucky they are not worthy to be called
friends," was my reply. "I don't believe those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
friends we wish to keep will desert us, mother. On
the contrary, I am certain they will respect us.
What people cannot stand in these days is genteel
poverty&mdash;its semi-starvation, its poor mean little
contrivances; but they respect a hand-to-hand fight
with circumstances, and when they see that we are
determined to overcome in the battle, then those
who are worth keeping will cling to us and help
us; and if all our friends turn out to be the other
sort, mother, why"&mdash;and here I rose and stretched
out my arms wide&mdash;"let them go, they are not
worth keeping. Those who won't be fond of us in
our new home in Bloomsbury we can do without."</p>

<p>"You are enthusiastic and&mdash;and ignorant," said
mother.</p>

<p>"I grant that I am enthusiastic," I answered.
"It would be a great pity if I had none of that
quality at one and twenty; but as to my ignorance,
well, time will prove. I should like, however, to ask
you a straight question, mother. Would father have
sat beside his guns and done nothing when the fight
was going against him? Was that the way he won
his Victoria Cross?"</p>

<p>Mother burst out crying. She never could bear
me to allude to that fatal and yet glorious occasion.
She rose now, weak and trembling, and said that
she must defer the discussion of ways and means
until the next day.</p>

<p>I put on my hat and went for a walk alone.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
I was full of hope, and not at all depressed. Girls
in these days are always glad to have something
new to do, and in the first rush of it, the idea
of leaving the humdrum path of ordinary society
and of entering on a new and vigorous career
filled me with ecstacy. I don't really think in the
whole of London there was a prouder girl than the
real Westenra Wickham; but I do not think I had
ordinary pride. To know titled people gave me no
special pleasure, and gay and pretty dresses were so
common with me that I regarded them as the
merest incidents in my life, and to be seen at big
receptions, and at those "At Homes" where you met
the most fastidious and the smartest folks, gave me
no joy whatsoever. It is true I was very fond of
my godmother, the Duchess of Wilmot, and of
another dear little American friend, who had married
a member of the Cabinet, Sir Henry Thesiger. But
beyond these two I was singularly free from any
special attachments. The fact is, I was in love with
mother. Mother herself seemed to fill all my life.
I felt somehow as if father had put some of his
spirit into me, and had bound me over by a solemn
vow to look after her, to comfort her, to guard her,
until he himself came to fetch her, and now my
thought of thoughts was how splendid and how
necessary it would be to keep her usual comforts
round my dainty, darling, lovely mother, to give her
the food she required, and the comfortable rooms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
and the luxury to which she was born; and I felt
that my pride, if I could really do that, would be so
great and exultant, that I should hold my head
higher than ever in the air. Yes, I would have a
downright good try, and I vowed I would not fail.
It seemed to me as I turned home again in the sweet
golden summer evening that fortune's ball lay at
my feet, that in the battle I would not be conquered,
that like my father I in my own way would win the
Victoria Cross.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="s08">FRIENDS OR QUONDAM FRIENDS</span></h2>

<p>Mother used to say that there were times when
her daughter Westenra swept her right off her feet.</p>

<p>"I can no more resist you," she used to remark
on these occasions, "than if you were a great flood
bearing me along."</p>

<p>Perhaps never did mother find my power so
strong, so determined as on the present occasion.
It was in vain for her, poor darling, to speak of our
friends, of those dear, nice, good people who had
loved father and for his sake were good to his
widow. I had my answer ready.</p>

<p>"It is just this, mother," I said, "what we do will
cause a gleaning&mdash;a sifting&mdash;amongst our friends.
Those who are worth keeping will stay with us,
those who are not worth keeping will leave us.
And now do you know what I mean to do? I
mean this morning, with your leave, to order the
carriage, the carriage which we must put down at
the end of the week, but which we can certainly
keep for the next couple of days, and go round
to our friends and tell them what we are about
to do."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>"You must go alone then, Westenra, for I cannot
go with you."</p>

<p>"Just as you please, mother. I would rather
you had the courage; but still, never mind, darling,
I will do it by myself."</p>

<p>Mother looked at me in despair.</p>

<p>"How old are you?" she said suddenly.</p>

<p>"You know quite well," I replied, "I was twenty-one
a month ago."</p>

<p>Mother shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>"If you really intend to carry out this awful idea,
West, you must consider youth a thing of the past,"
she said.</p>

<p>I smiled and patted her cheek.</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort," I answered; "I mean to
be young and vigorous and buoyant and hopeful as
long as I have you with me, so there! Now, may
I ring the bell and tell Paul to desire Jenkins to
bring the victoria round at eleven o'clock?"</p>

<p>Mother could not refuse, and having executed
this order I sat down with considerable appetite to
breakfast. I was really enjoying myself vastly.</p>

<p>Punctual to the hour, I stepped into our pretty
carriage. First of all I would visit my dear old
godmother, the Duchess of Wilmot.</p>

<p>Accordingly, early as it was, I told Jenkins to
drive me to the Duchess's house in Park Lane.
When we drew up at the house I jumped out, ran
up the steps and sounded the bell. The man who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
opened the door informed me that her Grace was at
home to no one at so early an hour.</p>

<p>I thought for a moment, then I scribbled something
on a little piece of paper.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Dear Duchess," I said, "I want to see you particularly,
the matter is very urgent.&mdash;Your god-daughter,</p>
<p class="smcap left45">Westenra Wickham."</p>
</div>

<p>This I twisted up and gave to the man.</p>

<p>"Give that to her Grace, I will wait to see if there
is an answer," I said.</p>

<p>He came down in a moment or two.</p>

<p>"Her Grace will see you, Miss Wickham," he said.</p>

<p>I entered the house, and following the footman
up some winding stairs and down some corridors, I
was shown into the small boudoir where the Duchess
generally sat in the morning. She was fully dressed,
and busily writing notes.</p>

<p>"That will do, Hartop," she said to the man;
"close the door, please. Now then, Westenra, what
is the meaning of this? What eccentric whim has
induced you to visit me at so early an hour?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to tell you something," I said; "mother
is awfully distressed, but I thought you had better
know."</p>

<p>"How queer you look, my child, and yet I seldom
saw you brighter or handsomer. Take off your hat
and sit near me. No, I am not specially busy. Is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
it about the Russells' reception? Oh, I can take
you if your mother is not strong enough. You
want to consult me over your dress? Oh, my dear
Westenra, you must wear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It has nothing to do with that," I interrupted.
"Please let me speak. I want to say something so
badly. I want to consult you."</p>

<p>"Of course," said her Grace.</p>

<p>She laid her jewelled hand on my arm. How I
loved that white hand! How I adored my beautiful
old friend! It would be painful to give her up.
Was she going to give me up?</p>

<p>"I will tell you something quite frankly," I said.
"I love you very much; you have always been
kind to me."</p>

<p>"I am your godmother, don't forget."</p>

<p>"A great trouble has come to us."</p>

<p>"A great trouble, my dear, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Mother thinks it a fearful trouble, and I suppose
it is, but anyhow there are two ways of taking
it. There is the sinking-down way, which means
getting small and poor and thin, anaemic, in short,
and there is the bold way, the sort of way when
you stand up to a thing, you know what I mean."</p>

<p>"You are talking school-boy language. My grandson
Ralph would understand you; he is here; do you
want to see him? I am a little too busy for riddles,
Westenra."</p>

<p>"Oh! I do beg your pardon. I know I am taking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
a great liberty: no one else would come to you at so
early an hour."</p>

<p>"Well, speak, my dear."</p>

<p>"We have lost our money."</p>

<p>"Lost your money!" cried the Duchess.</p>

<p>"Yes; everything, or nearly everything. It was
through some bad investments, and mother was not
at all to blame. But we have nothing left, or nearly
nothing&mdash;I mean we have a hundred and fifty a-year,
about the price of one of your dresses."</p>

<p>"Don't be personal, Westenra&mdash;proceed."</p>

<p>"Mother wants to live in a cottage in the
country."</p>

<p>"I do not see how she could possibly do it," said
the Duchess. "A cottage in the country! Why,
on that pittance she could scarcely afford a workman's
cottage, but I will speak to my friends; something
must be arranged immediately. Your dear,
lovely, fragile mother! We must get her a suite of
apartments at Hampton Court. Oh! my poor child,
this is terrible."</p>

<p>"But we do not choose to consider it terrible," I
replied, "nor will we be beholden to the charity of
our friends. Now, here is the gist of the matter. I
have urged mother to take a house in Bloomsbury."</p>

<p>"Bloomsbury?" said the Duchess a little vaguely.</p>

<p>"Oh, please Duchess, you must know. Bloomsbury
is a very nice, healthy part of the town. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
are big Squares and big houses; the British Museum
is there&mdash;now, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, that dreary pile, and you would
live close to it. But why, why? Is it a very cheap
neighbourhood?"</p>

<p>"By no means; but city men find it convenient,
and women who work for their living like it also,
and country folks who come to town for a short
time find it a good centre. So we mean to go there,
and&mdash;and make money. We will take our furniture
and make the house attractive and&mdash;and take paying
guests. We will keep a boarding-house. Now
you know."</p>

<p>I stood up. There was a wild excited feeling all
over me. The most daring flight of imagination
could never associate the gracious Duchess of Wilmot
with a lodging-house keeper, and mother had always
hitherto been the Duchess's equal. I had never before
felt <i>distrait</i> or nervous in the Duchess's presence,
but now I knew that there was a gulf between us&mdash;that
I stood on one side of the gulf and the Duchess
on the other. I stretched out my hands imploringly.</p>

<p>"I know you will never speak to me again, you
never can, it is not to be thought of. This is good-bye,
for we must do it. I see you understand.
Mother said that it would part us from our friends,
and I thought she was wrong, but I see now that
she was right. This is good-bye."</p>

<p>Before she could prevent me I dropped on my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
knees and raised the jewelled hand to my lips, and
kissed it passionately.</p>

<p>"Oh, for heaven's sake, Westenra," said the
Duchess then, "don't go into hysterics, nor talk in
that wild way. Sit down again quietly, dear, and
tell me what sort of person is a boarding-house
keeper."</p>

<p>Her tone made me smile, and relieved the
tension.</p>

<p>"Don't you really know?" I asked; "did you
never hear of people who take paying guests? They
swarm at the seaside, and charge exorbitant prices."</p>

<p>"Oh, and rob you right and left," said the Duchess;
"yes, my friends have told me of such places. As a
rule I go to hotels by preference, but do you mean,
Westenra, that your mother is going to live in apartments
for the future?"</p>

<p>"No, no," I answered wildly; "she will have a
house, and she and I, both of us, will fill it with
what they call paying guests. People will come and
live with us, and pay us so much a week, and we
will provide rooms for them, and food for them, and
they will sit with us in the drawing-room and, and&mdash;<i>perhaps</i>
we will have to amuse them a little."</p>

<p>The Duchess sank feebly back in her chair. She
looked me all over.</p>

<p>"Was there ever?" she asked, "I scarcely like to
ask, but was there ever any trace of insanity in your
family?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>"I have never heard that there was," I replied.
"It is certainly not developing in me. I have always
been renowned for my common sense, and it is coming
well to the fore now."</p>

<p>"My poor child," said the Duchess tenderly. She
drew me close to her. "You are a very ignorant
little girl, Westenra," she said, "but I have always
taken a deep interest in you. You are young, but
you have a good deal in your face&mdash;you are not
exactly pretty, but you have both intelligence and,
what is more important from my point of view, distinction
in your bearing. Your father was my dear
and personal friend. The man he rescued, at the
cost of his own life, was my relation. I have known
your mother too since we were both girls, and when
she asked me, after your dear father's death, to stand
sponsor to his child I could not refuse. But now,
what confused rigmarole are you bringing to my
ears? When did the first symptoms of this extraordinary
craze begin?"</p>

<p>"A fortnight ago," I answered, "when the news
came that our money, on which we had been living
in great peace and comfort, had suddenly vanished.
The investments were not sound, and one of the
trustees was responsible. You ought to blame him,
and be very angry with him, but please don't blame
me. I am only doing the best I can under most
adverse circumstances. If mother and I went to the
country we should both die, not, perhaps, of physical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
starvation, but certainly of that starvation which
contracts both the mind and soul. It would not
matter at all doing without cream and meat, you
know, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh dear," interrupted the Duchess, "I never felt
more bewildered in my life. Whatever goes wrong,
Westenra, people have to live, and now you speak of
doing without the necessaries of life."</p>

<p>"Meat and cream are not necessary to keep one
alive," I replied; "but of course you have never
known the sort of people who do without them. I
should certainly be hand and glove with them if I
went into the country, but in all probability in the
boarding-house in Bloomsbury we shall be able to
have good meals. Now I must really say good-bye.
Try and remember sometimes that I am your god-daughter ... and
that mother loves you very much.
Don't <i>quite</i> give us both up&mdash;that is, as far as your
memory is concerned."</p>

<p>The Duchess bustled to her feet. "I can't make
you out a bit," she said. "Your head has gone
wrong, that is the long and short of it, but your
mother will explain things. Stay to lunch with
me, Westenra, and afterwards we will go and have
a talk with your mother. I can either send her a
telegram or a note."</p>

<p>"Oh, I cannot possibly wait," I replied. "I drove
here to-day, but we must give up the carriage at
the end of the week, and I have other people to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
see. I must go immediately to Lady Thesiger.
You know what a dear little Yankee she is, and
so wise and sensible."</p>

<p>"She is a pretty woman," said the Duchess, frowning
slightly, "but she does not dress well. Her
clothes don't look as if they grew on her. Now
you have a very lissom figure, dear; it always
seems to be alive, but <i>have</i> I heard you aright?
You are going to live in apartments. No; you are
going into the country to a labourer's cottage&mdash;no,
no, it isn't that; you are going to let apartments to
people, and they are not to have either cream or
meat. They won't stay long, that is one comfort.
My poor child, we must get you over this craze.
Dr. Paget shall see you. It is impossible that such
a mad scheme should be allowed for a moment."</p>

<p>"One thing is certain, she does not take it in,
poor darling," I said to myself. "You are very
kind, Duchess," I said aloud, "and I love you better
than I ever loved you before," and then I kissed
her hand again and ran out of the room. The last
thing I saw of her round, good-humoured face, was
the pallor on her cheeks and the tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>Lady Thesiger lived in a large flat overlooking
Kensington Gardens. She was not up when I called,
but I boldly sent my name in; I was told that her
ladyship would see me in her bathroom. I found
her reclining on a low sofa, while a pretty girl was
massaging her face.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>"Is that you, Westenra?" she said; "I am
charmed to see you. Take off your hat. That will
do, Allison; you can come back in half-an-hour. I
want to be dressed in time for lunch."</p>

<p>The young woman withdrew, and Lady Thesiger
fixed her languid, heavily-fringed eyes on my
face.</p>

<p>"You might shut that window, Westenra," she
said, "that is, if you mean to be good-natured. Now
what is it? you look quite excited."</p>

<p>"I am out of bondage, that is all," I said. I
never treated Jasmine with respect, and she was a
power in her way, but she was little older than I,
and we had often romped together on rainy days,
and had confided our secrets one to the other.</p>

<p>"Out of bondage? Does that mean that you
are engaged?"</p>

<p>"Far from it; an engagement would probably be
a state of bondage. Now listen, you are going to
be awfully shocked, but if you are the good soul I
think you are, you ought to help me."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am sure I will do anything; I admire you
very much, child. Dear me, Westenra, is that a
new way of doing your hair? Let me see. Show
me your profile? I am not sure whether I quite
like it. Yes, on the whole, I think I do. You have
pretty hair, very pretty, but now, confess the truth,
you do wave it; all those little curls and tendrils
are not natural."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>"As I love you, Jasmine, they are," I replied.
"But oh, don't waste time now over my personal
appearance. What do you think of my physical
strength? Am I well made?"</p>

<p>"So-so," answered Lady Thesiger, opening her
big dark eyes and gazing at me from top to toe.
"I should say you were strong. Your shoulders are
just a trifle too broad, and sometimes I think you
are a little too tall, but of course I admire you
immensely. You ought to make a good marriage;
you ought to be a power in society."</p>

<p>"From this hour, Jasmine," I said, "society and I
are at daggers drawn. I am going to do that sort
of thing which society never forgives."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, what?" Lady Thesiger quite
roused herself. She forgot her languid attitude,
and sat up on her elbow. "Do pass me that box
of Fuller's chocolates," she said. "Come near and
help yourself; they are delicious, aren't they?"</p>

<p>I took one of the sweetmeats.</p>

<p>"Now then," said her ladyship, "speak."</p>

<p>"It is this. I must tell you as briefly as possible&mdash;mother
and I have lost our money."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," said the little lady, "what a pity that
so many people do lose their money&mdash;nice people,
charming people who want it so much; but if that
is all, it is rather fashionable to be poor. I was
told so the other day. Some one will adopt you,
dear; your mother will go into one of the refined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
order of almshouses. It is quite the fashion, you
know, quite."</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense," I said, and all the pride
which I had inherited from my father came into my
voice. "You may think that mother and I are low
down, but we are not low enough to accept charity.
We are going to put our shoulders to the wheel; we
are going to solve the problem of how the poor live.
We will work, for to beg we are ashamed. In short,
Jasmine, this diatribe of mine leads up to the fact
that we are going to start a boarding-house. Now
you have the truth, Jasmine. We expect to have
charming people to live with us, and to keep a large
luxurious house, and to retrieve our lost fortune.
Our quondam friends will of course have nothing to
do with us, but our real friends will respect us. I
have come here this morning to ask you a solemn
question. Do you mean in the future to consider
Westenra Wickham, the owner of a boarding-house,
your friend? If not, say so at once. I want in
this case to cut the Gordian knot quickly. Every
single friend I have shall be told of mother's and
my determination before long; the Duchess knows
already."</p>

<p>"The Duchess of Wilmot?" said Lady Thesiger
with a sort of gasp. She was sitting up on the
sofa; there was a flush on each cheek, and her
eyes were very bright. "And what did the Duchess
say, Westenra?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p>"She thinks I am mad."</p>

<p>"I agree with her. My poor child. Do let me
feel your forehead. Are you feverish? Is it influenza,
or a real attack of insanity?"</p>

<p>"It is an attack of downright common-sense," I
replied. I rose as I spoke. "I have told you,
Jasmine," I said, "and now I will leave you to
ponder over my tidings. You can be my friend
in the future and help me considerably, or you can
cut me, just as you please. As to me, I feel intensely
pleased and excited. I never felt so full of
go and energy in my life. I am going to do that
which will prevent mother feeling the pinch of
poverty, and I can tell you that such a deed is
worth hundreds of 'At Homes' and receptions and
flirtations. Why, Jasmine, yesterday I was nobody&mdash;only
a London girl trying to kill time by wasting
money; but from this out I am somebody. I am
a bread-winner, a labourer in the market. Now,
good-bye. You will realise the truth of my words
presently. But I won't kiss you, for if you decide
to cut me you might be ashamed of it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="s08">MY SCHEME</span></h2>

<p>I arrived home early in the afternoon.</p>

<p>"Dear mother," I said, "I had an interview with
the Duchess of Wilmot and with Lady Thesiger.
After seeing them both, I had not the heart to go
on to any more of our friends. I will describe my
interview presently, but I must talk on another
matter now. Our undertaking will be greatly
prospered if our friends will stick to us and help
us a little. If, on the other hand, we are not
to depend on them, the sooner we know it the
better."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked my mother.</p>

<p>"Well, of course, mother dear, we will have our
boarding-house. I have thought of the exact sort
of house we want. It must be very large and very
roomy, and the landlord must be willing to make
certain improvements which I will suggest to him.
Our boarding-house will be a sort of Utopia in its
way, and people who come there will want to come
again. We will charge good prices, but we will
make our guests very comfortable."</p>

<p>Mother clasped my hand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, dear child," she said. "How little
you know about what you are talking. We shall
have an empty house; no one will come to us.
Neither you nor I have the faintest idea how to
manage. We shall not only lose all the money we
have, but we shall be up to our ears in debt. I
do wish, Westenra, you would consider that simple
little cottage in the country."</p>

<p>"If it must come to our living within our means,"
I said slowly, "I have not the least doubt that the
Duchess of Wilmot would allow me to live with her
as a sort of companion and amanuensis, and influence
would be brought to bear to get you rooms in
Hampton Court; but would you consent, mother
darling, would you really consent that I should eat
the bread of dependence, and that you should live
partly on charity?"</p>

<p>Mother coloured. She had a very delicate colour,
and it always made her look remarkably pretty.
In her heart of hearts, I really do think she was
taken with the idea of Hampton Court. The ladies
who lived in those suites of apartments were more
or less aristocratic, they were at least all well connected,
and she and they might have much in
common. It was, in her opinion, rather a distinction
than otherwise to live there, but I would have none
of it.</p>

<p>"How old are you, mother?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Forty-three," she answered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>"Forty-three," I repeated. "Why, you are quite
young, just in the prime of middle-age. What do
you mean by sitting with your hands before you for
the rest of your life? You are forty-three, and I
am twenty-one. Do you think for a single moment
that able-bodied women, like ourselves, are to do
nothing in the future; for if I did go to the
Duchess my post would be merely a sinecure, and
you at Hampton Court would vegetate, nothing
more. Mother, you will come with me, and help
me? We will disregard society; if society is
ashamed of us, let it be ashamed, but we must find
out, and I have a scheme to propose."</p>

<p>"You are so full of schemes, Westenra, you quite
carry me away."</p>

<p>Dear mother looked bewildered, but at the same
time proud of me. I think she saw gleaming in
my eyes, which I know were bright and dark like
my father's, some of that spirit which had carried
him with a forlorn hope into the thickest of the
fight, and which enabled him to win the Victoria
Cross. There are a great many Victoria Crosses to
be secured in this world, and girls can get and
wear some of them.</p>

<p>"Now," I said, "we need not give up this house
until the autumn. The landlord will then take it
off our hands, and we shall move into our Bloomsbury
mansion, but as I did not quite succeed to-day
in knowing exactly how we stood with our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
friends, I propose that next week we should give
an 'At Home,' a very simple one, mother, nothing
but tea and sweet cakes, and a few sandwiches, no
ices, nothing expensive."</p>

<p>"My dear Westenra, just now, in the height of the
season, would any one come?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they will come, I will write to all the
friends I know, and they will come out of curiosity.
We will invite them for this day fortnight. I don't
know any special one of our friends who has an
'At Home' on the third Friday in the month.
But let me get our 'At Home' book and see."</p>

<p>I looked it out, and after carefully examining the
long list of our acquaintances, proclaimed that I
thought the third Friday in the month was a
tolerably free day.</p>

<p>"We will ask them to come at three," I said, "a
little early in the afternoon, so that those who do
want to go on to friends afterwards, will have plenty
of time."</p>

<p>"But why should they come, Westenra; why this
great expense and trouble, just when we are parting
with them all, for if I go to Hampton Court, or the
country, or to that awful boarding-house of yours,
my poor child, my days in society are at an
end."</p>

<p>"In one sense they are, mother, nevertheless, I
mean to test our friends. People are very democratic
in these days, and there is no saying, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
that I may be more the fashion than ever; but
I don't want to be the fashion, I want to get help
in the task which is before me. Now, do hear me
out."</p>

<p>Mother folded her hands in her lap. Her lips
were quivering to speak, but I held her in control
as it were. I stood before her making the most of
my slender height, and spoke with emphasis.</p>

<p>"We will ask all our friends. Paul will wait on
them, and Morris shall let them in, and everything
will be done in the old style, for we have just the
same materials we ever had to give a proper and
fashionable 'At Home,' but when they are all assembled,
instead of a recitation, or music, I will
jump up and stand in the middle of the room, and
briefly say what we mean to do. I will challenge
our friends to leave us, or to stick to us."</p>

<p>"Westenra, are you mad? I can never, never
consent to this."</p>

<p>"It is the very best plan, and far less troublesome
than going round to everybody, and they will be
slightly prepared, for the dear Duchess will have
mentioned something of what I said this morning to
her friends, and I know she will come. She won't
mind visiting us here just once again, and Jasmine
will come, and&mdash;and many other people, and we will
put the thing to the test. Yes, mother, this day
fortnight they shall come, and I will write the invitations
to-night, and to-morrow you and I will go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
to Bloomsbury and look for a suitable house, for by
the time they come, mother, the house will have
been taken, and I hope the agreement made out, and
the landlord will have been consulted, and he will
make the improvements I suggest and will require.
It is a big thing, mother, a great big venture for two
lone women like ourselves, but we will succeed, darling,
we <i>must</i> succeed."</p>

<p>"You are a rock of strength, West," she answered,
half proudly, half sadly, "you are just like your
father."</p>

<p>That night I sent out the invitations. They were
ordinary notes of invitation, for on second thoughts
I resolved not to prepare our many acquaintances
beforehand. "Mrs. Wickham at home on such a
day," nothing more.</p>

<p>I posted the letters and slept like a top that
night, and in the morning awoke with the tingling
sensation which generally comes over me when I
have a great deal to do, and when there is an important
and very interesting matter at stake. I used
to feel like that at times when I was at school. On
the day when I won the big scholarship, and was
made a sort of queen of by the other girls, I had
the sensation very strongly, and I felt like it also
when a terrible illness which mother had a few
years ago came to a crisis, and her precious life lay
in the balance. Here was another crisis in my
career, almost the most important which had come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
to me yet, and I felt the old verve and the old strong
determination to conquer fate. Fate at present was
against me, but surely I was a match for it: I was
young, strong, clever, and I had a certain <i>entrée</i> into
society which might or might not help me. If
society turned its back on me, I could assuredly do
without it. If, on the other hand, it smiled on me,
success was assured in advance.</p>

<p>I ran downstairs to breakfast in the best of
spirits. I had put on my very prettiest white dress,
and a white hat trimmed with soft silk and
feathers.</p>

<p>"Why, Westenra, dressed already?" said mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, and you must dress too quickly, Mummy.
Oh, there is Paul. Paul, we shall want the victoria
at ten o'clock."</p>

<p>Paul seemed accustomed to this order now. He
smiled and vanished. None of our servants knew
that their tenure with us was ended, that within a
very short time mother and I would know the soft
things of life no more. We were dragging out our
last delicious days in the Land of Luxury; we were
soon to enter the Land of Hard Living, the Land
of Endeavour, the Land of Struggle. Might it not
be a better, a more bracing life than our present
one? At least it would be a more interesting life,
of that I made sure, even before I plunged into its
depths.</p>

<p>Mother ate her breakfast quite with appetite, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
soon afterwards we were driving in the direction of
Bloomsbury.</p>

<p>Jenkins, who had lived with us for years, and who
had as a matter of course imbibed some of the
aristocratic notions of our neighbourhood, almost
turned up his nose when we told him to stop at
the house of a well-known agent in Bloomsbury.
He could not, like the Duchess of Wilmot, confess
that he did not know where Bloomsbury was, but
he evidently considered that something strange and
by no means <i>comme il faut</i> had occurred.</p>

<p>Presently we reached our destination, it was only
half-past ten.</p>

<p>"Won't you get out, mother?" I asked as I
sprang to the pavement.</p>

<p>"Is it necessary, dear child?" replied mother.</p>

<p>"I think it is," I answered; "you ought to appear
in this matter, I am too young to receive the
respect which I really merit, but with you to help
me&mdash;oh, you will do <i>exactly</i> what I tell you, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"My dear girl!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mummy, you will, you will."</p>

<p>I took her hand, and gave it a firm grip, and we
went into the house-agent's together.

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="s08">THE VERDICT</span></h2>

<p>The first thing I noticed when I entered the large
room where Messrs Macalister &amp; Co. carried on their
business, was a young man, tall and very well set
up, who stood with his back to us. He was talking
earnestly to one of Macalister's clerks, and there
was something about his figure which caused me to
look at him attentively. His hair was of a light
shade of brown, and was closely cropped to his well-shaped
head, and his shoulders were very broad and
square. He was dressed well, and had altogether
that man-of-the-world, well bred sort of look, which
is impossible to acquire by any amount of outward
veneer. The man who stood with his back to us,
and did not even glance round as we came into the
agent's office, was beyond doubt a gentleman. I felt
curiously anxious to see his face, for I was certain it
must be a pleasant one, but in this particular fate
did not favour me. I heard him say to the clerk in
a hurried tone&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will come back again presently," and then he
disappeared by another door, and I heard him walking
rapidly away. Mother had doubtless not noticed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
the man at all. She was seated near a table, and
when the clerk in question came up to her, seemed
indisposed to speak. I gave her a silent nudge.</p>

<p>"We want&mdash;ahem," said my mother&mdash;she cleared
her throat, "we are anxious to look at some houses."</p>

<p>"Fourteen to fifteen bedrooms in each," I interrupted.</p>

<p>"Fourteen to fifteen bedrooms," repeated mother.
"How many sitting rooms, Westenra?"</p>

<p>"Four, five, or six," was my answer.</p>

<p>"Oh, you require a mansion," said the agent.
"Where do you propose to look for your house,
madam?"</p>

<p>He addressed mother with great respect. Mother
again glanced at me.</p>

<p>"We thought somewhere north," she said; "or
north-west," she added.</p>

<p>"W.C.," I interrupted; "Bloomsbury, we wish to
settle in Bloomsbury."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Westenra," said my mother, "you had
better describe the house. My daughter takes a
great interest in houses," she added in an apologetic
tone to the clerk. The face of the clerk presented
a blank appearance, he showed neither elation nor
the reverse at having a young lady to deal with
instead of an old lady. He began to trot out his
different houses, to explain their advantages, their
aristocratic positions.</p>

<p>"Aristocratic houses in Bloomsbury&mdash;aristocratic!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
said mother, and there was a tone of almost scorn
in her voice.</p>

<p>"I assure you it is the case, madam. Russell
Square is becoming quite the fashion again, and so
is"&mdash;he paused&mdash;"Would Tavistock Square suit
you?" he said, glancing at me.</p>

<p>"I do not know," I answered. "I seem to be
better acquainted with the names of Russell Square
or Bloomsbury Square. After all, if we can get a
large enough house it does not greatly matter, provided
it is in Bloomsbury. We wish to see several
houses, for we cannot decide without a large choice."</p>

<p>"You would not be induced, ladies, to think of a
flat?" queried the agent.</p>

<p>Mother glanced at me; there was almost an
appeal in her eyes. If I could only be induced
to allow her to live in a tiny, tiny flat&mdash;she and
I alone on our one hundred and fifty a year&mdash;but
my eyes were bright with determination, and I said
firmly&mdash;</p>

<p>"We wish to look at houses, we do not want a
flat."</p>

<p>Accordingly, after a little more argument, we were
supplied with orders to view, and returning to the
carriage I gave brief directions to Jenkins.</p>

<p>During the rest of the morning we had a busy
time. We went from one house to another. Most
were large; some had handsome halls and wide
staircases, and double doors, and other relics of past
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
grandeur, but all were gloomy and dirty, and mother
became more and more depressed, and more and
more hopeless, as she entered each one in turn.</p>

<p>"Really, Westenra," she said, "we cannot do it.
No, my darling, it is hopeless. Think of the staff
of servants we should require. Do look at these
stairs, it is quite worth counting them. My dear
child, such a life would kill me."</p>

<p>But I was young and buoyant, and did not feel
the stairs, and my dreams seemed to become more
rosy as obstacles appeared in view. I was determined
to conquer, I had made up my mind to
succeed.</p>

<p>"Whatever happens you shall not have a tiring
time," I said affectionately to my dear mother, and
then I asked one of the caretakers to give her a
chair, and she sat in the great wide desolate
drawing-room while I ran up and down stairs, and
peeped into cupboards, and looked all over the
house, and calculated, as fast as my ignorant brain
would allow me, the amount of furniture which
would be necessary to start the mansion I had in
view.</p>

<p>For one reason or another most of the houses on
the agent's list were absolutely impossible for our
purpose, but at last we came to one which seemed
to be the exact thing we required. It was a corner
house in a square called Graham Square, and was
not so old by fifty years as the houses surrounding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
it. In height also it was a storey lower, but being
a corner house it had a double frontage, and was in
consequence very large and roomy. There were quite
six or seven sitting rooms, and I think there were
up to twenty bedrooms in the house, and it had a
most cheerful aspect, with balconies round the
drawing-room windows, and balconies to the windows
of the bedrooms on the first floor. I made
up my mind on the spot that the inmates of these
special rooms should pay extra for the privilege of
such delightful balconies. And the windows of the
house were large, and when it was all re-papered
and re-painted according to my modern ideas, I
knew that we could secure a great deal of light in
the rooms; and then besides, one whole side faced
south-east, and would scarcely ever be cold in
winter, whereas in summer it would be possible to
render it cool by sun-blinds and other contrivances.
Yes, the house would do exactly.</p>

<p>I ran downstairs to mother, who had by this time
given up climbing those many, many stairs, and told
her that I had found the exact house for our purpose.</p>

<p>"Seventeen Graham Square is magnificent," I
said. "My dearest, darling mother, in ten years
time we shall be rich women if we can only secure
this splendid house for our purpose."</p>

<p>"We do not even know the rent," said mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, the rent," I cried. "I forgot about that.
I will look on the order to view."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>I held it in my hand and glanced at it. Just for
a moment my heart stood still, for the corner house
commanded a rental of two hundred and eighty
pounds a year. Not at all dear for so big a
mansion, but with rates and taxes and all the
other etceteras it certainly was a serious item for
us to meet, and would be considered even by the
most sanguine people as a most risky speculation.</p>

<p>"Never mind, never mind," I cried eagerly, "we
will secure this house; I do not think we need look
at any of the others."</p>

<p>I crumpled up the remaining orders. Mother
stepped into the carriage, and Jenkins took us back
to the agent's.</p>

<p>"You must speak this time, Westenra," said
mother. "Remember it is your scheme, darling;
I am not at all accustomed to this sort of business;
it will be necessary for you to take the initiative."</p>

<p>"Very well, mother, I will; and suppose you stay
in the carriage." I uttered these last words in a
coaxing tone, for the tired look on her face almost
frightened me, and I did not want her to take any
of the worry of what I already called to myself
"Westenra's grand scheme."</p>

<p>I entered the office, and the man who had attended
to us in the morning came forward. I told
him briefly that of the many houses which we had
looked over, the only one which would suit our
purpose was No. 17 Graham Square.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah," he answered, "quite the handsomest house
on our list. Do you want it for your own occupation,
Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wickham," I said. "Yes, of course we want
the house for ourselves&mdash;that is, mother would like
to rent it."</p>

<p>"It is a high rent," said the man, "not of course
high for such a fine mansion, but higher than the
rest of the houses in the Square. It contains a
great many rooms." He glanced at me as though
he meant to say something impertinent, but, reading
an expression of determination on my face, he
refrained.</p>

<p>"How soon can we take possession of the house?"
I asked. "It would of course be papered and painted
for us?"</p>

<p>"If you take a lease, not otherwise," answered
Macalister's clerk.</p>

<p>"I think we would take a lease," I replied.
"What is the usual length?"</p>

<p>"Seven, fourteen, twenty-one years," he answered
glibly; "but I do not think the landlords round here
would grant a longer lease than fourteen years."</p>

<p>"Oh, that would be quite long enough," I answered
emphatically. "We should like to arrange
the matter as soon as possible, we are greatly pleased
with the house. Of course the drains must be carefully
tested, and the entire place would have to be
re-decorated from cellar to attic."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p>"For a fourteen years' lease I doubt not this
would be done," said the man, "but of course there
are several matters to be gone into. You want the
house for a private residence, do you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and no," I said faintly. There was a room
just beyond where I was seated, and at that moment
I heard a book fall heavily to the ground. It startled
me. Was any one in there listening to what we were
saying?</p>

<p>The clerk stepped forward and quietly closed the
door.</p>

<p>"To be frank with you," I said, "we wish to
secure 17 Graham Square in order to start a
boarding-house there."</p>

<p>The man immediately laid down the large book
in which he had been taking my orders.</p>

<p>"That will never do," he said. "We cannot
allow business of any sort to be carried on in the
house, it would destroy all the rest of the property.
It is far too aristocratic for anything of the
kind."</p>

<p>"But our house would be practically private," I
said; "I mean," I continued, stammering and blushing,
and feeling ready to sink through the floor,
"that our guests would be extremely nice and well-behaved
people."</p>

<p>"Oh, I have no doubt whatever of that," replied
the clerk, "but there is a condition in every lease
in that special Square, that money is not to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
earned on the premises. I presume your guests
would not come to you for nothing?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," I replied. I felt myself turning
cold and stiff. All the angry blood of my noble
ancestors stirred in my veins. I said a few more
words and left the shop.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked mother. She was looking dreary
and terribly huddled up in the carriage. It was a
warm day, but I think going through those empty
houses had chilled her. "Well, Westenra, have you
taken No. 17?"</p>

<p>"Alas! no," I answered in some heat; "would
you believe it, mother, the agent says the landlord
will not let us the house if we make money in it."</p>

<p>"If we make money in it? I do not understand,"
answered mother. Her blue eyes were fixed on my
face in an anxious way.</p>

<p>"Why, mother, darling, don't you know we meant
to fill the house with paying guests."</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot," said mother. "Home, Jenkins,
as fast as possible."</p>

<p>Jenkins whipped up the horses, and we trotted
home. Mother looked distinctly relieved.</p>

<p>"So you have not taken the house?" she said.</p>

<p>"I cannot get it," I answered. "It is more than
provoking. What are we to do? I had taken such
a fancy to the place."</p>

<p>"It did seem, for that benighted place, fairly
cheerful," said my mother, "but, Westenra, there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
a Providence guiding our paths. Doubtless Providence
does not intend you to wreck your young life
attending to lodgers."</p>

<p>"But, mother dear, don't you understand that we
must do something for our living? It is disappointing,
but we shall get over it somehow."</p>

<p>During the rest of that day mother refused even
to discuss the boarding-house scheme. She seemed
to think that because we could not get 17 Graham
Square, there was no other house available for our
purpose.</p>

<p>The next day I went out without mother. I did
not visit the same agent. After finding myself in
Bloomsbury I repaired to a post-office, and, taking
down the big Directory, secured the names of several
agents in the neighbourhood. These I visited in
turn. I had dressed myself very plainly; I had
travelled to my destination by 'bus. I thought that
I looked exactly what I felt&mdash;a very business-like
young woman. Already the gulf was widening between
my old and my new life. Already I was
enjoying my freedom.</p>

<p>Once more I was supplied with a list of houses,
and once again I trotted round to see them. Alack
and alas! how ugly empty houses did look; how
dilapidated and dirty were the walls without the
pictures and bookcases! How dreary were those
countless flights of stairs, those long narrow windows,
those hopelessly narrow halls; and then, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
neighbourhood of these so-called mansions was so
sordid. Could we by any possible means brighten
such dwellings? Could we make them fit to live
in? I visited them all, and finally selected three
of these. Two had a clause forbidding the letting
out of apartments, but the third and least desirable
of the houses was to be the absolute property of the
tenant to do what he liked with.</p>

<p>"That mansion," said the obliging agent, "you
can sublet to your heart's content, madam. It is
a very fine house, only one hundred and eighty
pounds a year. There are ten bedrooms and five
sitting-rooms. You had better close with it at
once."</p>

<p>But this I could not do. The outlook from this
house was so hideous; the only way to it was
through an ugly, not to say hideous, thoroughfare.
I thought of my delicate, aristocratic mother here.
I thought of the friends whom I used to know
visiting us in 14 Cleveland Street, and felt my
castle in the clouds tumbling about my ears. What
was to be done!</p>

<p>"I cannot decide to-day," I said; "I will let you
know."</p>

<p>"You will lose it, madam," said the agent.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I cannot decide so soon; I must
consult my mother."</p>

<p>"Very well, madam," said the man, in a tone of
disappointment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>I left his office and returned home.</p>

<p>For the next few days I scarcely spoke at all
about my project. I was struggling to make up
my mind to the life which lay before us if we took
14 Cleveland Street. The street itself was somewhat
narrow; the opposite houses seemed to bow
at their neighbours; the rooms, although many,
were comparatively small; and last, but by no
means least, the landlord would do very little in
the way of decoration.</p>

<p>"We can let houses of this kind over and over
again," said the agent, "I don't say that Mr.
Mason won't have the ceilings whitened for you,
but as to papering, no; the house don't require
it. It was done up for the last tenant four years
ago."</p>

<p>"And why has the last tenant left?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Owing to insolvency, madam," was the quick
reply, and the man darted a keen glance into my
face.</p>

<p>Insolvency! I knew what that meant. It was
another word for ruin, for bankruptcy. In all
probability, if we took that detestable house, we
also would have to leave on account of insolvency,
for what nice, cheerful, paying guests would
care to live with us there? I shook my head.
Surely there must be somewhere other houses to
let.</p>

<p>During the next few days I spent all my time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
searching for houses. I got quite independent, and,
I think, a little roughened. I was more brusque
than usual in my manners. I became quite an
adept at jumping in and out of omnibuses. I could
get off omnibuses quite neatly when they were
going at a fairly good pace, and the conductors, I
am sure, blessed me in their hearts for my agile
movements. Then the agents all round Bloomsbury
began to know me. Finally, one of them said,
on the event of my fourth visit&mdash;</p>

<p>"Had you not better try further afield, Miss?
There are larger, brighter, and newer houses in the
neighbourhood of Highbury, for instance."</p>

<p>"No," I said, "we must live in Bloomsbury."
Then I noticed that the man examined me all over
in quite a disagreeable fashion, and then he said
slowly&mdash;</p>

<p>"14 Cleveland Street is still to be had, Miss, but
of course you understand that the landlord will
want the usual references."</p>

<p>"References!" I cried. "He shall certainly have
them if he requires them." And then I wondered
vaguely, with a queer sinking at my heart, to whom
of all our grand friends I might apply who would
vouch for us that we would not run away without
paying the rent. Altogether, I felt most uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The days passed. No more likely houses appeared
on the horizon, and at last the afternoon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
came when our friends were to visit us, when I,
Westenra, was to break to these fashionable society
people my wild project. But I had passed through
a good deal of the hardening process lately, and was
not at all alarmed when the important day dawned.
This was to be our very last entertainment. After
that we would step down.</p>

<p>Mother, exquisitely dressed in dove-coloured satin,
waited for her guests in the drawing-room. I was
in white. I had given up wearing white when I
was going about in omnibuses, but I had several
charming costumes for afternoon and evening wear
still quite fresh, and I donned my prettiest dress
now, and looked at my face in the glass with a
certain amount of solicitude. I saw before me a
very tall, slender girl; my eyes were grey. I had
a creamy, pale complexion, and indifferently good
features. There were some people who thought me
pretty, but I never did think anything of my looks
myself. I gave my own image a careless nod now,
and ran briskly downstairs.</p>

<p>"You'll be very careful what you say to our
guests, Westenra?" queried mother. "This whole
scheme of yours is by no means to my liking. I
feel certain that the dear Duchess and Lady Thesiger
will feel that they have been brought here unfairly.
It would have been far franker and better to tell
them that something singularly unpleasant was
about to occur."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p>"But, dearest mother, why should it be unpleasant?
and it is the fashion of the day to have
sensation at any cost. Our guests will always look
back on this afternoon as a sort of red letter day.
Just think for yourself how startled and how interested
they will be. Whether they approve, or
whether they disapprove, it will be immensely
interesting and out of the common, mother. O
mother! think of it!" I gripped her hand tightly,
and she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't squeeze me so hard, Westenra, I shall
need all my pluck."</p>

<p>Well, the hour came and also the guests. They
arrived in goodly numbers. There was the usual
fashionable array of carriages outside our door.
There were footmen in livery and coachmen, and
stately and magnificently groomed horses, and the
guests poured up the stairs and entered our drawing
rooms, and the chatter-chatter and hum-hum of
ordinary society conversation began. Everything
went as smoothly as it always did, and all the time
my mother chatted with that courtly grace which
made her look quite in the same state of life as the
Duchess of Wilmot. In fact the only person in the
room who looked at all nervous was the said Duchess.
She had a way of glancing from me to mother, as
if she was not quite sure of either of us, and once
as I passed her, she stretched out her hand and
touched me on my sleeve.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<p>"Eh, Westenra?" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, your Grace," I replied.</p>

<p>"All that silliness, darling, that you talked to me
the other day, is quite knocked on the head, is it
not? Oh, I am so relieved."</p>

<p>"You must wait and find out," was my reply.
"I have something to say to every one soon, and oh
please, try not to be too shocked with me."</p>

<p>"You are an incorrigible girl," she replied, but
she shook her head quite gaily at me. She evidently
had not the slightest idea of what I was
going to do.</p>

<p>As to my special friend Jasmine Thesiger, she
was as usual surrounded by an admiring group of
men and women, and gave me no particular thought.
I looked from one to the other of all our guests: I
did not think any more were likely to come. All
those who had been specially invited had arrived.
My moment had come. Just then, however, just
before I rose from my seat to advance into the
middle of the room, I noticed coming up the stairs
a tall, broad-shouldered man. He was accompanied
by a friend of ours, a Mr. Walters, a well-known
artist. I had never seen this man before, and yet
I fancied, in a sort of intangible way, that his figure
was familiar. I just glanced at him for a moment,
and I do not believe he came into the room. He
stood a little behind Mr. Walters, who remained in
the doorway. My hour had come. I glanced at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
mother. Poor darling, she turned very white. I
think she was almost terrified, but as to myself I
felt quite cheerful, and not in the least alarmed.</p>

<p>"I want to say something to all my dear friends,"
I began. I had a clear voice, and it rose above the
babel. There came sudden and profound silence.</p>

<p>I saw a lady nudge her neighbour.</p>

<p>"I did not know," I heard her say, "that
Westenra recited," and then she settled herself in a
comfortable attitude to listen.</p>

<p>I stood in the middle of the floor, and faced everybody.</p>

<p>"I have something to say," I began, "and it is
not a recitation. I have asked you all to come here
to-day to listen to me." I paused and looked round.
How nice our guests looked, how kind, how beautifully
dressed! What good form the men were in,
and how aristocratic were the women. How different
these men and women were from the people I
had associated with during the week&mdash;the people who
took care of the houses in Bloomsbury, the agents
who let the houses, the people whom I had met in
the busses going to and from the houses. These nice,
pleasant, well-bred people belonged to me, they were
part and parcel of my own set; I was at home with
them.</p>

<p>I just caught the Duchess's eye for a moment, and
I think there was alarm in those brown depths, but
she was too essentially a woman of the world to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
show anything. She just folded her jewelled hands
in her lap, leant back in her chair, and prepared to
listen. One or two of the men, I think, raised their
eye-glasses to give me a more critical glance, but
soon even that mark of special attention subsided.
Of course it was a recitation. People were beginning
to be tired of recitations.</p>

<p>"I want to say something, and I will say it as
briefly as possible," I commenced. "Mother does
not approve of it, but she will do it, because she
has yielded to me as a dear, good, <i>modern</i> mother
ought."</p>

<p>Here there was a little laugh, and some of the
tension was lessened.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you all," I continued, "for most
of you have been our friends since I was a child, that
mother and I are&mdash;poor. There is nothing disgraceful
in being poor, is there? but at the same
time it is unpleasant, unfortunate. We were fairly
well off. Now, through no fault of our own, we
have lost our money."</p>

<p>The visitors looked intensely puzzled, and also
uncomfortable, but now I raised my eyes a little
above them. It was necessary that if I went on
putting them to the test, I should not look them
full in the face.</p>

<p>"We are poor," I continued, "therefore we cannot
live any longer in this house. From having a fair
competence, not what many of you would consider
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
riches, but from having a fair competence, we have
come down to practically nothing. We could live,
it is true, in the depths of the country, on the very
little which has been saved out of the wreck, but I
for one do not wish to do that. I dislike what is
called decent poverty, I dislike the narrow life, the
stultifying life, the mean life. I am my father's
daughter. You have heard of my father, that is
his picture"&mdash;I pointed as I spoke to an oil painting
on the wall. "You know that he was a man of
action, I also will act." I hurried my voice a trifle
here&mdash;"So mother and I mean not to accept what
many people would consider the inevitable; but we
mean, to use a vulgar phrase, to better ourselves."</p>

<p>Now it is certain, our guests were a little surprised.
They began to fidget, and one or two men
came nearer, and I thought, though I am not sure,
that I saw the tall man, with the head of closely
cropped hair, push forward to look at me. But I
never looked any one full in the eyes; I fixed mine
on father's picture. I seemed to hear father's voice
saying to me&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go on, Westenra, that was very good, you and
I are people of action, remember."</p>

<p>So I went on and I explained my scheme. I told
it very briefly. Mother and I would in future earn
our own living.</p>

<p>I was educated fairly well, but I had no special
gifts, so I would not enter the Arena where teachers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
struggled and fought and bled, and many of them
fell by the wayside. Nor would I enter the Arena
of Art, because in no sense of the word was I an
artist, nor would I go on the Stage, for my talent
did not lie in that direction, but I had certain talents,
and they were of a practical sort. I could keep
accounts admirably; I could, I believed, manage a
house. Then I skilfully sketched in that wonderful
boarding-house of my dreams, that house in dull
Bloomsbury, which by my skill and endeavour would
be bright and render an acceptable home for many.
Finally, I said that my mother and I had made up
our minds to leave the fashionable part of London
and to retire to Bloomsbury.</p>

<p>"We will take our house from September," I said,
"and advertise very soon for paying guests, and we
hope the thing will do well, and that in ten or
twelve years we shall have made enough money to
keep ourselves for the future in comfort. Now," I
continued, "I appeal to no one to help us. We do
not intend to borrow money from anybody, and the
only reason I am speaking to you to-day is because
I wish, and I am sure mother agrees with me, to be
quite frank with you. Mother and I know quite
well that we are doing an absolutely unconventional
thing, and that very likely you, as our friends of the
past, will resent it. Those of you who do not feel
that you can associate with two ladies who keep a
boarding-house, need not say so in so many words,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
but you can give us to understand, by means known
best to yourselves, whether you will know us in the
future. If you want to cut us we shall consider it
quite right, quite reasonable, quite fair. Then those
who do intend to stick to us, even through this
great change in our lives, may be the greatest possible
help by recommending us and our boarding-house
to their friends, that is, if any of you present
have friends who would live in Bloomsbury.</p>

<p>"Mother and I thought it quite fair that you
should know, and we thought it best that I should
tell you quite simply. We are neither of us
ashamed, and mother approves, or at least she will
approve presently, of what I have done."</p>

<p>There was a dead silence when I ceased speaking,
followed by a slight rustling amongst the ladies.
The men looked one and all intensely uncomfortable,
and the tall man who had come in with Mr Walters,
the artist, disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>I had not been nervous while I was speaking, but
I felt nervous now. I knew that I was being
weighed in the balance, that I and my scheme were
being held up before the mental eyes of these people
with the keenest, most scathing criticism. Would
one in all that crowd understand me? I doubted
it. Perhaps in my first sensation of sinking and
almost despair something of my feeling stole into
my face, for suddenly Jasmine sprang to her feet
and said in an excited, tremulous voice&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<p>"I for one say that Westenra is a very plucky
girl. I wish her God speed, and I hope her scheme
will succeed."</p>

<p>This was very nice indeed of Jasmine, but I do
not know that it relieved the situation much, for
still the others were silent, and then one lady got up
and went over to mother and took her hand and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am very sorry for you, dear Mrs. Wickham,
very sorry indeed. I fear I must say good-bye now;
I am very sorry. Good-bye, dear Mrs. Wickham."</p>

<p>And this lady's example was followed by most of
the other ladies, until at last there was no one left
in the room but the Duchess of Wilmot and Lady
Thesiger and ourselves. Lady Thesiger's cheeks
were brightly flushed.</p>

<p>"My dear Westenra," she said, "you are one of
the most eccentric creatures in creation. Of course
from first to last you are as wrong as you can be.
You know nothing about keeping a boarding-house,
and you are bound to fail. I could not say so
before all those ridiculous people, who would not
have understood, but I say so now to you. My dear
girl, your speech was so much Greek to them. You
spoke over their heads or under their feet, just as
you please to put it, but comprehend you they did
not. You will be the talk of the hour, and they
will mention you as a girl whom they used to know,
but who has gone a little mad, and then you will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
forgotten. You would have done fifty times better
by keeping this thing to yourself."</p>

<p>"That is precisely what I think," said the Duchess.
"My dear Mary," she added, turning to my mother,
"what is the matter with your child? Is she quite
<i>right</i>?" The Duchess gave an expressive nod, and I
saw mother's face turn pale.</p>

<p>"Oh, do listen to me for a moment," interrupted
pretty Lady Thesiger, "what I say is this. Westenra
is on the wrong tack. If she wishes to earn money,
why must she earn it in this preposterous, impossible
manner? It would be fifty times better for her to
go as a teacher or a secretary, but to keep a boarding-house!
You see for yourself, dear Mrs. Wickham,
that it is impossible. As long as we live in
society we must adhere to its rules, and for West
calmly to believe that people of position in London
will know her and respect her when she is a boarding-house
keeper, is to expect a miracle. Now, I
for one will not cut you, Westenra."</p>

<p>"Nor will I cut you, Westenra," said the Duchess,
and she gave a profound sigh and folded her hands
in her lap.</p>

<p>"Two of your friends will not cut you, but I
really think all the others will," said Lady Thesiger.
"Then I suppose you expect me to recommend nice
Americans to come and stay with you, but it is my
opinion that, with your no knowledge at all of this
sort of thing, you will keep a very so-so, harum-scarum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
sort of house. How can I recommend my
nice American friends to be made thoroughly uncomfortable
by you? Oh, I am <i>very</i> sorry for you."</p>

<p>Lady Thesiger got up as she spoke; she kissed
me, squeezed my hand, and said, "Oh child, what a
goose you are!" and left the room.</p>

<p>The Duchess followed more slowly.</p>

<p>"I don't forget, my child," she said, "that I am
your godmother, that I loved your dear father, that
I love your mother, that I also love you. Do not
be wilful, Westenra; give up this mad scheme.
There are surely other ways open to you in this
moment of misfortune. Above all things, try not to
forget that you are your father's daughter."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="s08">JANE MULLINS</span></h2>

<p>On the evening which followed our last "At Home,"
mother came to me, and earnestly begged of me to
pause and reflect.</p>

<p>"Wherever you go I will go, Westenra," she said;
"that may be taken as a matter of course, but I do
think you are wrong to go against all the wishes of
our friends."</p>

<p>"But our friends won't do anything for us,
Mummy!" I answered, "and they will forget us
just as soon in the cottage in the country, as they
will in the boarding-house in town; sooner, in fact,
if that is any consolation to you, and I do want to
try it, Mummy, for I cannot be buried alive in the
country at twenty-one."</p>

<p>"Then I will say no more," replied mother. "I
only trust the way may be made plain for us, for at
present I cannot see that it is; but if we can find
a suitable house, and take it, I will go with you,
West, although, darling, I hate the thing&mdash;I do
truly."</p>

<p>After this speech of mother's it can easily be
supposed that I slept badly that night. I began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
for the first time in my life to doubt myself, and my
own judgment. I began even seriously to consider
the cottage in the country with its genteel poverty,
and I began to wonder if I was to spend the remainder
of my youth getting thinner in mind and
body, day by day, and hour by hour.</p>

<p>"Anæmic," I said to myself. "In the country
with no money, and no interests, I shall become
anæmic. My thoughts will be feeble and wanting
in force, and I shall die long before my time a
miserable old maid. Now, there are no real old
maids in London. The unmarried women are just
as full of force, and go, and common-sense, and
ambition, and happiness as the married ones; but
in the country, oh, it is different. There old age
comes before its time. I knew that I was not the
girl to endure having nothing to do, and yet that
seemed to be my appointed portion. So during the
night I shed very bitter tears, and I hated society for
its coldness and want of comprehension. I longed
more frantically than ever to find myself in the
midst of the people, where "a man was a man for
a' that," and mere veneer went for nothing. But
if mother's heart was likely to be broken by my
taking this step, and if there was no house for me
but 14 Cleveland Street, I doubted very much
whether I could go on with my scheme. Judge
therefore of my surprise and delight, when on the
following morning, mother handed me a letter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
which she had just received. It was from Messrs.
Macalister &amp; Co.</p>

<p>"Read it," she said, "I do not quite know what
it means."</p>

<p>I read the letter quickly, it ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,&mdash;We write to acquaint you, that
we have just had an interview with Mr. Hardcastle,
the landlord of 17 Graham Square, and he desires us
to say, that he is willing in your case to come to terms
with regard to his house, and if you will take it for
a lease of fourteen years, he will do it up for you,
in the most approved style, and according to your
own taste; he also withdraws his embargo to your
letting apartments, or having paying guests in your
house.</p>

<p>"Under the circumstances, we shall be glad to hear
if you still entertain the idea of taking this mansion.</p>

<p>&mdash;Yours faithfully,</p>
<p><span class="smcap left45">Macalister &amp; Co</span>."</p>
</div>

<p>"Oh mother!" I cried, "this is just splendid!"
My spirits rose with a bound. Anxious as I was to
possess a boarding-house, I hated going to 14 Cleveland
Street, but 17 Graham Square was a house
where any one might be happy. It was charmingly
built; it was large, commodious, cheerful, and then
the landlord&mdash;he must be a delightful man when
he withdrew his embargo, when he permitted us&mdash;<i>us</i>
to have paying guests in our dwelling. Even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Jasmine need not be ashamed to send her nice, rich
American friends to 17 Graham Square.</p>

<p>"This is splendid, mother!" I repeated.</p>

<p>"Dear me, Westenra," said mother, looking pale
and troubled, "what house is he alluding to? I
saw so many that first day, darling, and the only
impression they left upon me was, that they were
all stairs and narrowness; they seemed to go up
and up, for ever and ever, my legs ache even now
when I think of them."</p>

<p>"But you cannot forget 17 Graham Square," I
said, "the last house we saw ... the corner-house.
You recollect the hall, how wide it was, and you
know there were darling balconies, and you shall have
one, little mother, all to yourself, and such a sweet
sun-blind over it, and you can keep your favourite
plants there, and be, oh, so happy! Mother&mdash;mother,
this is magnificent!"</p>

<p>"I do recall the house now," said mother, "it was
not quite as bad as the other houses; but still,
Westenra, what does this mean? Why should there
be an exception made in our favour?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that I know nothing about," I answered,
"I suppose the landlord was not going to be so silly
as to lose good tenants."</p>

<p>"And what is the rent of the house ... I forget."</p>

<p>"Two hundred and something," I said in a careless
tone, "not at all high for such a house, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
the landlord, Mr. Hardcastle, will do it up for
us. Mother, we will have the carriage, and go and
make our arrangements immediately."</p>

<p>"Then you are quite determined, West?"</p>

<p>"Mother, dear mother, I do think father would
like us to do it."</p>

<p>Now, whenever I spoke of my dead father,
mother looked intensely solemn and subdued. Once
she told me that she thought there was a strong
link between my father's spirit and mine, and that
at times I spoke so exactly like him, and made use
of the identically same expressions, and in short
impressed her with the feeling that he was close to
her. I did not often use my father's name, therefore,
as a means of power over my mother, but I
did use it now; and, with the usual result, she got
up gently and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"We had better go and see the house once
more."</p>

<p>We did go, we drove straight to the agents, and
got the order to view, and went all over 17 Graham
Square. Our second visit was far more delightful
than the first, for the agent's clerk accompanied us.
We found him in an excellent humour, most willing
to offer suggestions and to accept any suggestions of
ours. Not that mother made any, it was I who,
with my usual daring, spoke of this improvement
and the other.</p>

<p>But darling mother became a little cheerful when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
she stood in that noble drawing-room and saw the
sun shining in bars across the floor, and the agent's
clerk was quite astonishingly cheery; he knew just
the colour the paper ought to be, for instance, and
the tone of the paint, and he even suggested what
curtains would go with such paper and such paint.
I never saw a man so improved. He had lost his
brusqueness, and was very anxious to please us.</p>

<p>"It is extraordinary," said mother afterwards;
"really I never knew that house-agents could be
such agreeable people. No. 17 Graham Square is a
handsome house, Westenra, it is a great pity that it
is not situated in Mayfair."</p>

<p>"But mother, dear mother, we could not have a
boarding-house in the very midst of our friends," I
said with a smile; "we shall do splendidly in Graham
Square, and we should not do at all well in Mayfair."</p>

<p>When we returned to the agents, Mr. Macalister
himself, one of the heads of the firm, came and
interviewed us. After answering a great many
questions, it was finally decided that he was to see
Mr. Hardcastle, the landlord, and that the landlord
was to have an interview the next day with mother;
and the agent further agreed that the landlord
should call on mother at our own house in Sumner
Place, and then we drove home.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is completed now," said mother,
"the thing is done. Well, child, you are having your
own way; it will be a lesson to you, I only trust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
we shall not be quite ruined. I am already puzzled
to know how we are to meet that enormous rent."</p>

<p>But at that moment of my career I thought
nothing at all about the rent. That night I slept
the sleep of the just, and was in high spirits the
following day, when the landlord, a nice, jovial, rosy-faced
man, arrived, accompanied by the agent. They
both saw my mother, who told them frankly that
she knew nothing about business, and so perforce
they found themselves obliged to talk to me. Everything
was going smoothly until Mr. Hardcastle said
in the very quietest of tones&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of course you understand, Mrs. Wickham, that
I shall require references. I am going to lay out a
good deal of money on the house, and references are
indispensable."</p>

<p>"Of course," answered mother, but she looked
pale and nervous.</p>

<p>"What sort of references?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Tradesmen's references are what we like best,"
was his reply; "but your banker's will be all-sufficient&mdash;an
interview with your banker with regard
to your deposit will make all safe."</p>

<p>Then mother turned paler than ever, and looked
first at me and then at Mr. Hardcastle. After a
pause she said slowly&mdash;</p>

<p>"My daughter and I would not undertake our present
scheme if we had capital&mdash;we have not any."</p>

<p>"Not any?" said Mr. Hardcastle, looking blank,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
"and yet you propose to take a house with a rental
of two hundred and eighty pounds a year."</p>

<p>"We mean to pay the rent out of the profit we
get from the boarders," I replied.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardcastle did not make use of an ugly word,
but he raised his brows, looked fixedly at me for a
moment, and then shook his head.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he said, rising; "I would do a great
deal to oblige you, for you are both most charming
ladies, but I cannot let my house without references.
If you, for instance, Mrs. Wickham, could
get any one to guarantee the rent, I should be
delighted to let you the house and put it in order,
but not otherwise."</p>

<p>He added a few more words, and then he and the
agent, both of them looking very gloomy, went away.</p>

<p>"I shall hear from you doubtless on the subject of
references," said Mr. Hardcastle as he bowed himself
out, "and I will keep the offer open until Saturday."</p>

<p>This was Wednesday, we had three days to spare.</p>

<p>"Now, Westenra," said my mother, "the thing
has come to a stop of itself. Providence has interfered,
and I must honestly say I am glad. From
the first the scheme was mad, and as that nice,
jovial looking Mr. Hardcastle will not let us the
house without our having capital, and as we have
no capital, there surely is an end to the matter. I
have not the slightest doubt, West, that all the
other landlords in Bloomsbury will be equally particular,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
therefore we must fall back upon our little
cottage in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, mother," I interrupted, "no; I own that
at the present moment I feel at my wits' end,
but I have not yet come to the cottage in the
country."</p>

<p>I think there were tears in my eyes, for mother
opened her arms wide.</p>

<p>"Kiss me," she said.</p>

<p>I ran into her dear arms, and laid my head on
her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are the sweetest thing on earth," I
said, "and it is because you are, and because I love
you so passionately, I will not let you degenerate.
I will find my way through somehow."</p>

<p>I left mother a moment later, and I will own it,
went to my own lovely, lovely room, suitable for a
girl who moved in the best society, and burst into
tears. It was astonishing what a sudden passion I
had taken, as my friends would say, to degrade
myself; but this did not look like degradation in my
eyes, it was just honest work. We wanted money,
and we would earn it; we would go in debt to no
man; we would earn money for ourselves. But
then the thought came to me, "Was my scheme too
expensive? had I any right to saddle mother with
such an enormous rent?" I had always considered
myself a very fair arithmetician, and I now sat down
and went carefully into accounts. I smile to this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
day as I think of myself seated at my little table in
the big bay window of my bedroom, trying to make
out with pencil and paper how I could keep
17 Graham Square going&mdash;I, a girl without capital,
without knowledge, without any of the sort of experience
which alone could aid me in a crisis of
this sort.</p>

<p>I spent the rest of the day in very low spirits, for
my accounts would not, however hard I tried, show
any margin of profit.</p>

<p>The more difficulties came in my way, however,
the more determined was I to overcome them.
Presently I took a sheet of paper and wrote a few
lines to Mr. Hardcastle. I knew his address, and
wrote to him direct.</p>

<p>"Dear sir," I said, "will you oblige me by
letting me know what capital my mother will
require in order to become your tenant for 17
Graham Square."</p>

<p>I signed this letter, adding a postscript, "An
early answer will oblige."</p>

<p>I received the answer about noon the following
day.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Wickham</span>,&mdash;Your letter puzzles me.
I see you have a great deal of pluck and endeavour,
and I should certainly do my utmost to please you,
but I cannot let you have the house under a capital
of five thousand pounds."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>The letter fell from my hands, and I sat in blank
despair. Five thousand pounds is a small sum to
many people, to others it is as impossible and as
unget-at-able as the moon. We, when our debts
were paid, would have nothing at all to live on
except the annuity which my mother received from
the Government, and a small sum of fifty pounds
a year.</p>

<p>I began dismally to consider what rent we must
pay for the awful cottage in the country, and to
what part of the country it would be best to retire,
when Paul came into the room and presented me
with a card.</p>

<p>"There's a lady&mdash;a person, I mean&mdash;downstairs,
and she wants to see you, Miss."</p>

<p>I took the card and read the name&mdash;Miss Jane
Mullins.</p>

<p>"Who is she?" I asked; "I don't know her."</p>

<p>"She's a sort of betwixt and between, Miss. I
showed her into the li'bry. I said you was most
likely engaged, but that I would inquire."</p>

<p>"Miss Jane Mullins." I read the name aloud.
"Show her up, Paul," I said then.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear West, what do you mean?" said
mother; "that sort of person has probably called
to beg."</p>

<p>"She may as well beg in the drawing-room as
anywhere else," I said. "I have rather taken a
fancy to her name&mdash;Jane Mullins."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span></p>

<p>"A hideous name," said mother; but she did not
add any more, for the next moment there came a
rustle of harsh silk on the landing, the drawing-room
door was flung open by Paul in his grandest
style, and Miss Jane Mullins walked in. She entered
quickly, with a determined step. She was a little
woman, stoutly built, and very neatly and at the
same time quietly dressed. Her dress was black
silk, and I saw at a glance that the quality of the
silk was poor. It gave her a harsh appearance,
which was further intensified by a kind of fixed
colour in her cheeks. Her face was all over a sort
of chocolate red. She had scanty eyebrows and
scanty hair, her eyes were small and twinkling, she
had a snub nose and a wide mouth. Her age might
have been from thirty-five to forty. She had, however,
a great deal of self-possession, and did not
seem at all impressed by my stately-looking mother
and by my tall, slender self.</p>

<p>As she had asked particularly to see me, mother
now retired to the other end of the long drawing-room
and took up a book. I invited Miss Mullins
to a chair.</p>

<p>"I would a great deal rather you called me Jane
at once and have done with it," was her remarkable
response to this; "but I suppose Jane will come in
time." Here she heaved a very deep sigh, raised
her veil of spotted net, and taking out her handkerchief,
mopped her red face.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a warm day," she said, "and I walked most
of the way. I suppose you would like me to proceed
to business. I have come, Miss Wickham&mdash;Miss
Westenra Wickham&mdash;to speak on the subject
of 17 Graham Square."</p>

<p>"Have you?" I cried. Had the ground opened
I could not have been more amazed. What had
this little, rather ugly woman, to do with my dream-house,
17 Graham Square?</p>

<p>"It is a very beautiful, fine house," said the little
woman. "I went all over it this morning. I heard
from your agents, Messrs. Macalister &amp; Co., that you
are anxious to take it."</p>

<p>I felt that my agents were very rude in thus
giving me away, and made no response beyond a
stately bend of my head. I was glad that mother
was occupying herself with some delicate embroidery
in the distant window. She certainly could not hear
our conversation.</p>

<p>Miss Mullins now pulled her chair forward and sat
in such a position that her knees nearly touched mine.</p>

<p>"You'll forgive a plain question," she said; "I
am here on business. Are you prepared to take
the house?"</p>

<p>"We certainly wish to take it," I said.</p>

<p>"But are you going to take it, Miss Wickham?"</p>

<p>I rather resented this speech, and was silent.</p>

<p>"Now I'll be plain. My name is blunt, and so is
my nature. I want the house."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>I half rose.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Miss Wickham, and don't be silly."</p>

<p>This speech was almost intolerable, and I thought
the time had come when I should call to mother to
protect me, but Jane Mullins had such twinkling,
good-humoured eyes, that presently my anger dissolved
into a curious desire to laugh.</p>

<p>"I know, Miss Wickham, you think me mad, and
I was always accounted a little queer, but I'll beat
about the bush no longer. You want 17 Graham
Square, and so do I. You have got beauty and
good birth and taste and style, and your name and
your appearance will draw customers; and I have
got experience and"&mdash;here she made a long, emphatic
pause&mdash;"<i>money</i>. Now my question is this:
Shall we club together?"</p>

<p>I never in all my life felt more astonished, I was
nearly stunned.</p>

<p>"Club together?" I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, shall we? Seven thousand pounds capital
has been placed at my disposal. You, I understand,
have got furniture, at least some furniture"&mdash;here
she glanced in a rather contemptuous way round
our lovely drawing-room. "You also, of course,
have a certain amount of connection, and I have
got a large and valuable connection. Shall we club
together?"</p>

<p>"I do not think we have any connection at all,"
I said bluntly; "not one of our friends will notice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
us when we go to&mdash;to Bloomsbury, and we have not
half enough furniture for a house like 17 Graham
Square. But what do you mean by our clubbing
together?"</p>

<p>"Let me speak, my dear. What I want is this.
I want you to put your furniture, what there is of
it, and your connection, what there is of it, and your
good birth and your style, and your charming
mother into the same bag with my experience and
my capital&mdash;or rather, the capital that is to be
given to me. Will you do it? There's a plain
question. Is it to be yes, or is it to be no? I
want 17 Graham Square, and so do you. Shall we
take it together and make a success of it? I like
you, you are honest, and you're nice to look at, and
I don't mind at all your being stiff to me and thinking
me queer, for by-and-by we'll be friends. Is it
to be a bargain?"</p>

<p>Just then mother rose from her seat and came
with slow and stately steps across the room.</p>

<p>"What is it, Westenra?" she said; "what does
this&mdash;this lady want?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not a lady, ma'am," said Jane Mullins,
rising and dropping a sort of involuntary curtsey.
"I'm just a plain body, but I know all about cooking,
and all about servants, and all about house linen,
and all about dusting, going right into corners and
never slurring them, and all the rest, and I know
what you ought to give a pound for beef and for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
mutton, and what you ought to give a dozen for
eggs, and for butter, and how to get the best and
freshest provisions at the lowest possible price. I
know a thousand things, my dear madam, that you
do not know, and that your pretty daughter doesn't
know, and what I say is; as we both want 17 Graham
Square, shall we put our pride in our pockets and
our finances into one bag, and do the job. My name
is Jane Mullins. I never was a grand body. I'm
plain, but I'm determined, and I am good-humoured,
and I am true as steel. I can give you fifty-four
references if you want them, from a number of very
good honest tradesmen who know me, and know that
I pay my debts to the uttermost farthing. Will you
join me, or will you not?"</p>

<p>"Well," said mother, when this curious little
person had finished speaking, "this is quite the
most astounding thing I ever heard of in my life.
Westenra dear, thank this person very kindly, tell
her that you know she means well, but that of
course we could not think of her scheme for a single
moment."</p>

<p>Mother turned as she spoke, and walked up the
drawing-room again, and I looked at Jane Mullins,
and Jane Mullins looked at me, and her blue eyes
twinkled. She got up at once and held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Then that's flat," she said; "you'll be sorry you
have said it, for Jane Mullins could have done well
by you. Good-bye, miss; good-bye, ma'am."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p>She gave a little nod in the direction of my stately
mother, and tripped out of the room. I was too
stunned even to ring the bell for Paul, and I think
Jane Mullins let herself out.</p>

<p>Well, as soon as she was gone, mother turned on
me and gave me the first downright absolute scolding
I had received since I was a tiny child. She
said she had been willing, quite willing, to please me
in every possible way, but when I descended to talk
to people like Jane Mullins, and to consider their proposals,
there was an end of everything, and she could
not, for my father's sake, hear of such an outrageous
proposal for a moment. This she said with tears in
her eyes, and I listened quite submissively until at
last the precious darling had worn her anger out,
and sat subdued and inclined to cry by the open
window. I took her hand then and petted her. I
told her that really my scolding was quite unmerited,
as I had never heard of Jane Mullins before, and was
as much amazed as she was at her visit.</p>

<p>"All the same," I added, "I have not the slightest
doubt that, with Jane Mullins at the helm, we should
do splendidly."</p>

<p>"My darling, darling West, this is just the straw
too much," said mother, and then I saw that it was
the straw too much, and at that moment who should
come to visit us but pretty little Lady Thesiger. We
turned the conversation instinctively. Lady Thesiger
said&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>"You have not yet gone under, either of you,
you are only talking about it. You are quite fit to
associate with me for the rest of the day. I want
you to come for a long drive in my carriage, and
afterwards we will go to the theatre together; there
is a very good piece on at the Lyceum. Now, then,
be quick, Westenra, get into your very smartest
clothes, and Mrs. Wickham, will you also put on
your bonnet and mantle?"</p>

<p>There was never any resisting Jasmine, and we
spent the rest of the day with her, and she was
absolutely winning, and so pleasant that she made
mother forget Jane Mullins; but then during dinner,
in the queerest, most marvellous way, she drew the
whole story of Jane Mullins from us both, and mother
described with great pride her action in the matter.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is all very fine," replied Jasmine; "but
now I am going to say a plain truth. I am going
to imitate that wonderful little Jane. My truth is
this&mdash;I would fifty thousand times rather introduce
my nice American friends to Jane Mullins's boarding-house
than I would to yours, Westenra, for in Jane's
they would have their wants attended to, and be
thoroughly comfortable, whereas in yours goodness
only knows if the poor darlings would get a meal
fit to eat."</p>

<p>This was being snubbed with a vengeance, and
even mother looked angry, and I think she thought
that Lady Thesiger had gone too far.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<p>During the play that followed, and the drive home
and the subsequent night, I thought of nothing but
Jane Mullins, and began more and more to repent
of my rash refusal of her aid. Surely, if Providence
had meant us to carry out our scheme, Providence
had also supplied Jane Mullins to help us to do it,
and if ever woman looked true she did, and if her
references turned out satisfactory why should she
not be a sort of partner-housekeeper in the concern?</p>

<p>So the next morning early I crept into mother's
room, and whispered to her all about Jane and my
thoughts during the night, and begged of her to
reconsider the matter.</p>

<p>"It is very odd, West," said mother, "but what
your friend Jasmine said has been coming to me in
my dreams; and you know, darling, you know nothing
about cooking, and I know still less, and I suppose
this Miss Mullins would understand this sort of
thing, so, Westenra, if your heart is quite, quite set
on it, we may as well see her again."</p>

<p>"She left her address on her visiting-card. I
will go to her the moment I have finished breakfast,"
was my joyful response.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="s08">THE BERLIN WOOL ROOM</span></h2>

<p>I ordered the carriage and set off, mother having
declined to accompany me. Miss Mullins's address
was at Highgate; she lived in a small, new-looking
house, somewhere near the Archway. I daresay
Jane saw me from the window, for I had scarcely
run up the little path to her house, and had scarcely
finished sounding the electric bell, before the door
was opened by no less a person than herself.</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, "I felt somehow that you would
call; come in, Miss Wickham."</p>

<p>Her manner was extremely cordial, there was not
a trace of offence at the way in which we had both
treated her the day before. She ushered me into
a sort of little Berlin wool room, all looking as neat
as a new pin. There was Berlin wool everywhere,
on the centre-table, on the mantelpiece, on the little
side-table. There were Berlin wool antimacassars
and a Berlin wool screen, in which impossible birds
disported themselves over impossible water, and
there was a large waxwork arrangement of fruit
and flowers in the centre of the mantelpiece, and
there were six chairs, all with their backs decorously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
placed against the wall, and not a single easy
chair. But the room was spick and span with
cleanliness and brightness and the due effects of
soap and water and furniture-polish. The little
room even smelt clean.</p>

<p>Miss Mullins motioned me to one of the hard
chairs.</p>

<p>"I must apologise for the absence of the rocking-chair,"
she said, "it is being mended, but I dare say
being young you won't mind using that hard chair
for a little."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," I replied.</p>

<p>"I observe that every one lounges dreadfully just
now," she continued, "but I myself hate easy chairs,
and as this is my own house I do not have them in
it. The room is clean, but not according to your
taste, eh?"</p>

<p>"It is a nice room of its kind," I said, "but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You need not add any buts, I know quite well
what you are thinking about," said Jane Mullins;
then she stood right in front of me, facing me.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?" I said.</p>

<p>"No, thank you, I prefer standing. I only sit
when I have a good deal on my mind. What is it
you have come to say?"</p>

<p>I wished she would help me, but she had evidently
no intention of doing so. She stood there
with her red face and her twinkling eyes, and her
broad, good-humoured mouth, the very personification
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
of homely strength, but she was not going to
get me out of my difficulty.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, stammering and colouring, "I
have been thinking over your visit, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, go on."</p>

<p>"Do you really mean it, Miss Mullins?" I said
then. "Would you really like to join two such
ignorant people as mother and me?"</p>

<p>"Hark to her," said the good woman. "Look
here, Miss Wickham, you have reached quite the
right frame of mind, and you're not a bit ignorant,
my dear, not a bit, only your knowledge and my
knowledge are wide apart. My dear Miss Wickham,
knowledge is power, and when we join forces and
put our united knowledge into the same bag, we
will have huge results, huge results, my dear&mdash;yes,
it is true."</p>

<p>"Let us talk it out," I said.</p>

<p>"Do you really mean, Miss Wickham, that you
and your mother&mdash;your aristocratic mother&mdash;are
seriously thinking of entering into partnership with
me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about mother, but I know that I
am leaning very much towards the idea," I said;
"and I think I ought to apologise, both for my
mother and myself, for the rude way in which we
treated you yesterday."</p>

<p>"I expected it, love; I was not a bit surprised,"
said Jane Mullins. "I thought it best to plump
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
out the whole scheme and allow it to simmer in
your minds. Of course, at first, you were not likely
to be taken with it, but you were equally likely to
come round. I stayed in this morning on purpose;
I was almost sure you would visit me."</p>

<p>"You were right," I said. "I see that you are a
very wise woman, and I am a silly girl."</p>

<p>"You are a very beautiful girl, Miss Wickham,
and educated according to your station. Your
station and mine are far apart, but having got
capital and a certain amount of sense, it would be
a very good partnership, if you really think we
could venture upon it."</p>

<p>"I am willing," I said suddenly.</p>

<p>"Then, that is right; here's my hand upon it;
but don't be more impulsive to-day, my dear, than
you were yesterday. You must do things properly.
Here are different references of mine." She walked
across the room, took up a little packet, and opened
it.</p>

<p>"This is a list of tradespeople," she said; "I
should like you to write to them all; they will
explain to a certain extent my financial position;
they will assure you that I, Jane Mullins, have been
dealing with them for the things that I require for
the last seven years&mdash;a seven years' reference is
long enough, is it not? But if it is not quite long
enough, here is the address of the dear old Rector
in Shropshire who confirmed me, and in whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Sunday-school I was trained, and who knew my
father, one of the best farmers in the district.</p>

<p>"So much for my early life, but the most important
reference of all is the reference of the friend,
who does not choose his or her name to be
mentioned, and who is helping me with capital;
not helping you, Miss Wickham, mind&mdash;not you
nor Mrs. Wickham&mdash;but me <i>myself</i>, with capital to
the tune of seven thousand pounds. I could not
do it but for that, and as the person who is lending
me this money to make this great fortune happens
to be a friend of Mr. Hardcastle's, I think he, Mr.
Hardcastle, will let us have the house."</p>

<p>"Now this is all very startling and amazing," I
said. "You ought to tell us your friend's name
and all about it; that is, if we are to go properly
into partnership."</p>

<p>"It can't be done, my dear. The friend is a very
old friend and a very true one, and Mr. Hardcastle
is the one to be satisfied. The friend knows that
for years I have wanted to start a boarding-house,
but the friend always thought there were difficulties
in the way. I was too homely, and people are
grand in these days, and want some society airs
and manners, which you, my dear, possess. So if
we put our fortunes into one bag everything will
come right, and you must trust me, that's all."</p>

<p>I was quite silent, thinking very hard.</p>

<p>"When I saw 17 Graham Square yesterday,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
continued Miss Mullins, "I said to myself, if
there is a suitable house for our purpose in the
whole W.C. district it is that house. What a
splendid drawing-room there is, or rather two
drawing-rooms; just the very rooms to entertain
people in in the evening. Now if we put all our
fortunes into one bag, you, my dear Miss Wickham,
shall have the social part of the establishment under
your wing. I will arrange all about the servants,
and will see that the cooking is right, and will carve
the joints at dinner; and your beautiful, graceful,
aristocratic lady mother must take the head of the
table. She won't have a great deal to do, but her
presence will work wonders."</p>

<p>"And do you think we shall make any money
with this thing?" I said.</p>

<p>"It is my impression that we will; indeed I am
almost sure of it, but the house must be furnished
suitably."</p>

<p>"But what is your taste with regard to furniture,
Miss Mullins?" I asked, and now I looked apprehensively
round the little Berlin wool room.</p>

<p>"Well, I always did incline to the primitive
colours. I will be frank with you, and say honestly
that I never pass by that awful shop, Liberty's in
Regent Street, without shuddering. Their greens
and their greys and their pinks are not my taste,
love&mdash;no, and never will be; but I shall leave the
furnishing to you, Miss Wickham, for I see by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
tone of that dress you are now wearing that you
adhere to Liberty, and like his style of decoration."</p>

<p>"Oh, I certainly do," I replied.</p>

<p>"Very well then, you shall furnish in Liberty
style, or in any style you fancy; it does not matter
to me. You know the tastes of your own set, and
I hope we'll have plenty of them at No. 17, my
dear. As a matter of fact, all I care about in a
room is that it should be absolutely clean, free from
dust, tidily arranged, and not too much furniture in
it. For the rest&mdash;well, I never notice pretty things
when they are about, so you need not bother about
that as far as I am concerned. The house is a very
large one, and although you have some furniture to
meet its requirements, and what I have in this little
room will do for my own sitting-room, still I have
not the slightest doubt we shall have to spend about
a thousand pounds in putting the house into apple-pie
order; not a penny less will do the job, of that
I am convinced."</p>

<p>As I had no knowledge whatever on the subject
I could neither gainsay Miss Mullins nor agree with
her.</p>

<p>"The house must be the envy of all the neighbours,"
she said, and a twinkle came into her eyes
and a look of satisfaction round her mouth.</p>

<p>"Oh, it shall be. How delightful you are!" I
cried.</p>

<p>"What I propose is this," said Jane Mullins;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
"we&mdash;your mother, you and I&mdash;sign the lease, and
we three are responsible. I take one third of the
profits, you a third, and your mother a third."</p>

<p>"But surely that is not fair, for you are putting
capital into it."</p>

<p>"Not at all, it is my friend's capital, and that is
the arrangement my friend would like. Come, I
cannot work on any other terms. I take a third,
you a third, and your mother a third. I, having
experience, do the housekeeping. Having experience,
I order the servants. You arrange the decorations
for the table, you have the charge of the flowers and
the drawing-room in the evenings. As funds permit
and paying guests arrive you inaugurate amusements
in the drawing-room, you make everything as
sociable and as pleasant as possible. Your mother
gives tone and distinction to the entire establishment."</p>

<p>"You seem to be leaving very little for mother
and me to do," I said.</p>

<p>"Your mother cannot have much to do, for I do
not think she is strong," said Miss Mullins. "She
is older than I am too, and has seen a great deal of
sorrow; but what she does, remember no one else
can do, she gives <i>the tone</i>. It's a fact, Miss Wickham,
that you may try all your life, but unless Providence
has bestowed tone upon you, you cannot acquire it.
Now I have no tone, and will only obtrude myself
into the social circle to carve the joints at dinner;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
otherwise I shall be busy, extremely busy in my
own domain."</p>

<p>"Well, as far as I am concerned, I am abundantly
willing to enter into this partnership," I said. "I
like you very much, and I am sure you are honest
and true. I will tell mother what you have said to
me, and we will let you know immediately."</p>

<p>"All I ask is that you prove me, my dear," said
the little woman, and then she took my hand and
gave it a firm grip.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="s08">THE PAYING GUESTS</span></h2>

<p>Everything went smoothly after my interview with
Jane Mullins. In an incredibly short space of time
the contract for the house was signed. It was
signed by mother, by me, and by Jane Mullins.
Then we had exciting and extraordinary days hunting
for that furniture which Jane considered suitable,
and consulting about the servants, and the thousand
and one small minutiæ of the establishment. But
finally Jane took the reins into her own hands,
whisking my mother and me off to the country, and
telling us that we could come and take possession
on the 29th of September.</p>

<p>"There won't be any visitors in the house then,"
she said, "but all the same, the house will be full,
from attic to cellar, before the week is out, and you
had best be there beforehand. Until then enjoy
yourselves."</p>

<p>Well, I did enjoy myself very much. It was quite
terrible of me, for now and then I saw such a look
of sorrow on mother's face; but I really did get a
wonderful heartening and cheering up by Jane,
and when the weeks flew by, and the long desired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
day came at last, I found myself in excellent spirits,
but mother looked very pale and depressed.</p>

<p>"You will get accustomed to it," I said, "and I
think in time you will learn to like it. It is a brave
thing to do. I have been thinking of father so much
lately, and I am quite certain that he would approve."</p>

<p>"Do you really believe that, West?" asked my
mother; "if I thought so, nothing would really
matter. West, dearest, you are so brave and masculine
in some things, you ought to have been a man."</p>

<p>"I am very glad I am a woman," was my reply,
"for I want to prove that women can do just as
strong things as men, and just as brave things if
occasion requires."</p>

<p>So we arrived at the boarding-house, and Jane
Mullins met us on the steps, and took us all over it.
It was a curious house, and at the same time a very
beautiful one. There was a certain mixture of tastes
which gave some of the rooms an odd effect. Jane's
common-sense and barbarous ideas with regard to
colour, rather clashed with our æsthetic instincts
and our more luxurious ideas. But the drawing-room
at least was almost perfect. It was a drawing-room
after mother's own heart. In reality it was
a very much larger and handsomer room than the
one we had left in Sumner Place, but it had a
home-like look, and the colouring was in one
harmonious scheme, which took away from any
undue effect of size, and at the same time gave a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
delicious sense of space. The old pictures, too,
stood on the walls, and the old lovely curtains
adorned the windows; and the little easy chairs that
mother loved, stood about here and there, and all
the nicknacks and articles of vertu were to be
found in their accustomed places; and there were
flowers and large palms, and we both looked around
us with a queer sense of wonder.</p>

<p>"Why, mother," I said, "this is like coming home."</p>

<p>"So it is," said mother, "it is extraordinary."</p>

<p>"But Miss Mullins," I continued, "you told me
you had no taste. How is it possible that you were
able to decorate a room like this, and, you dear old
thing, the carpet on the floor has quite a Liberty tone,
and what a lovely carpet, too!"</p>

<p>Jane absolutely blushed. When she blushed it
was always the tip of her nose that blushed&mdash;it
blushed a fiery red now. She looked down, and
then she looked up, and said after a pause&mdash;</p>

<p>"I guessed that, just what I would not like you
would adore, so I did the furnishing of this room
on that principle. I am glad you are pleased. I
don't hold myself with cut flowers, nor nicknacks,
nor rubbish of that sort, but you do; and when
people hold with them, and believe in them, the
more they have of them round, the better pleased
they are. Oh, and there's a big box of Fuller's
sweetmeats on that little table. I thought you would
eat those if you had no appetite for anything else."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>"But I have an excellent appetite," I answered;
"all the same, I am delighted to see my favourite
sweets. Come, mother, we will have a feast, both
of us; you shall enjoy your favourite bon-bon this
minute."</p>

<p>Mother got quite merry over the box, and Jane
disappeared, and in five minutes or so, a stylishly
dressed parlour-maid came in with a <i>récherché</i> tea,
which we both enjoyed.</p>

<p>Mother's bedroom was on the first floor, a small
room, but a very dainty one; and this had been
papered with a lovely shade of very pale gold, and
the hangings and curtains were of the same colour.
There was a little balcony outside the window where
she could sit, and where she could keep her favourite
plants, and there in its cage was her old Bully, who
could pipe "Robin Adair," "Home, sweet Home,"
and "Charlie is my Darling." The moment he saw
mother he perked himself up, and bent his little
head to one side, and began piping "Charlie is my
Darling" in as lively a tone as ever bullfinch possessed.</p>

<p>I had insisted beforehand on having my room at
the top of the house not far from Jane's, for of
course the best bedrooms were reserved for the
boarders, the boarders who had not yet come.</p>

<p>"But I have sheafs of letters, with inquiries about
the house," said Jane, "and after dinner to-night,
my dear Miss Wickham, you and I must go into
these matters."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>"And mother, too," I said.</p>

<p>"Just as she pleases," replied Jane, "but would
not the dear lady like her little reading-lamp and
her new novel? I have a subscription at Mudie's,
and some new books have arrived. Would it not
be best for her?"</p>

<p>"No," I said with firmness, "mother must have
a voice in everything; she must not drop the reins,
it would not be good for her at all."</p>

<p>Accordingly after dinner we all sat in the drawing-room,
and Jane produced the letters. Mother and I
were dressed as we were accustomed to dress for the
evening. Mother wore black velvet, slightly, very
slightly, open at the throat, and the lace ruffles round
her throat and wrists were of Brussels, and she had
a figment of Brussels lace arranged with velvet and
a small feather on her head. She looked charming,
and very much as she might have looked if she had
been going to the Duchess's for an evening reception,
or to Lady Thesiger's for dinner.</p>

<p>As to me, I wore one of the frocks I had worn
last season, when I had not stepped down from
society, but was in the thick of it, midst of all the
gaiety and fun.</p>

<p>Jane Mullins, however, scorned to dress for the
evening. Jane wore in the morning a kind of black
bombazine. I had never seen that material worn
by anybody but Jane, but she adhered to it. It
shone and it rustled, and was aggravating to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
last degree. This was Jane's morning dress, made
very plainly, and fitting close to her sturdy little
figure, and her evening dress was that harsh silk
which I have already mentioned. This was also
worn tight and plain, and round her neck she had
a white linen collar, and round her wrists immaculate
white cuffs, and no cap or ornament of any
kind over her thin light hair. Jane was certainly
not beautiful to look at, but by this time mother
and I had discovered the homely steadfastness of
her abilities, and the immense good nature which
seemed to radiate out of her kind eyes, and we had
forgotten whether she was, strictly speaking, good-looking
or not.</p>

<p>Well, we three sat together on this first evening,
and Jane produced her letters.</p>

<p>"Here is one from a lady in the country," she
began; "she wishes to come to London for the
winter, and she wishes to bring a daughter with
her; the daughter requires lessons in something or
other, some useless accomplishment, no doubt&mdash;anyhow
that is their own affair. They wish to
come to London, and they want to know what we
will take them for as permanent boarders. The
lady's name is Mrs. Armstrong. Her letter of inquiry
arrived yesterday, and ought to be answered
at once. She adds in a postscript&mdash;'I hope you
will do me cheap.' I don't like that postscript; it
has a low, mean sort of sound about it, and I doubt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
if we will put up with her long, but, as she is the
very first to apply for apartments, we cannot tell
her that the house is full up. Now I propose that
we give Mrs. Armstrong and her daughter the large
front attic next to my room. If the young lady
happens to be musical, and wishes to rattle away on
a piano, she can have one there, and play to her
heart's content without anybody being disturbed.
She cannot play anywhere else that I can see, for
your lady mother, my dear Miss Wickham, cannot
be worried and fretted with piano tunes jingling in
her ears."</p>

<p>"West's mother must learn to put up with
disagreeables," was my mother's very soft reply.</p>

<p>But I did not want her to have any disagreeables,
so I said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perhaps we had better not have Mrs. Armstrong
at all."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear," was Jane's reply, "why should
my spite at that postscript turn the poor woman
from a comfortable home? She shall come. We
will charge three guineas a week for the two."</p>

<p>"But that is awfully little," I replied.</p>

<p>"It is quite as much as they will pay for the
attic, and they will be awfully worrying, both of
them. I feel it in my bones beforehand. They'll
be much more particular than the people who pay
five guineas a head for rooms on the first floor.
Mark my words, Miss Wickham, it is the attic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
boarders who will give the trouble, but we cannot
help that, for they are sure and certain, and are the
backbone of the establishment. I'll write to Mrs.
Armstrong, and say that if they can give us suitable
references they can come for a week, in order that
both parties may see if they are pleased with the
other."</p>

<p>"Shall I write, or will you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, after a bit I shall be very pleased
if you will take the correspondence, which is sure to
be a large item, but just at first I believe that I can
put things on a more business-like footing."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," I said in a relieved
tone.</p>

<p>"That letter goes to-night," said Jane. She took
a Swan fountain pen from its place by her waist,
scribbled a word or two on the envelope of Mrs.
Armstrong's letter, and laid it aside.</p>

<p>"Now I have inquiries from a most genteel party,
a Captain and Mrs. Furlong: he is a retired army
man, and they are willing to pay five guineas a
week between them for a comfortable bedroom."</p>

<p>"But surely that is very little," I said again.</p>

<p>"It is a very fair sum out of their pockets, Miss
Wickham, and I think we can afford to give them
a nice room looking south on the third floor, not on
the second floor, and, of course, not on the first; but
on the third floor we can give them that large room
which is decorated with the sickly green. It will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
turn them bilious, poor things, if they are of my
way of thinking."</p>

<p>Accordingly Captain and Mrs. Furlong were also
written to that evening, to the effect that they might
enter the sacred precincts of 17 Graham Square as
soon as they pleased.</p>

<p>Two or three other people had also made inquiries,
and having talked their letters over and arranged
what replies were to be sent, Miss Mullins, after a
certain hesitation which caused me some small
astonishment, took up her final letter.</p>

<p>"A gentleman has written who wishes to come,"
she said, "and I think he would be a desirable
inmate."</p>

<p>"A gentleman!" cried mother, "a gentleman
alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madam, an unmarried gentleman."</p>

<p>I looked at mother. Mother's face turned a little
pale. We had neither of us said anything of the
possibility of there being unmarried gentlemen in
the house, and I think mother had a sort of dim
understanding that the entire establishment was to
be filled with women and married couples. Now she
glanced at Jane, and said in a hesitating voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"I always felt that something unpleasant would
come of this."</p>

<p>Jane stared back at her.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Mrs. Wickham? The
gentleman to whom I allude is a real gentleman, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
it would be extremely difficult for me to refuse him,
because he happens to be a friend of the friend who
lent me the seven thousand pounds capital."</p>

<p>"There is a secret about that," I exclaimed, "and
I think you ought to tell us."</p>

<p>Jane looked at me out of her honest twinkling
eyes, and her resolute mouth shut into a perfectly
straight line; then nodding her head she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"We cannot refuse this gentleman; his name is
Randolph. He signs himself James Randolph, and
specially mentions the friend who lent the money,
so I do not see, as the house is almost empty at
present, how we can keep him out. I should say
he must be a nice man from the way he writes.
You have no objection to his coming, have you, Mrs.
Wickham?"</p>

<p>Still mother made no answer, but I saw a hot
spot coming into both her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you, Westenra," she said after a
pause, "that matters might be made very disagreeable
and complicated? To be frank with you, Miss
Mullins," she continued, "I would much rather have
only married couples and ladies in the house."</p>

<p>"Then, my dear madam, we had better close
within the week," said Jane Mullins in a voice of
some indignation. "You ought to have arranged
for this at the time, and if you had mentioned your
views I would certainly not have joined partnership
with you. What we want are ladies <i>and</i> gentlemen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
and so many of them that the commonplace and the
vulgar will not be able to come, because there will
not be room to receive them. As to this gentleman,
he has something to do in the city, and likes to live
in Bloomsbury, as he considers it the most healthy
part of London." Here Miss Mullins began to talk
very vigorously, and the tip of her nose became
suspiciously red once more.</p>

<p>"I propose," she continued, "as he is quite indifferent
to what he pays, charging Mr. Randolph
five guineas a week, and giving him the small bedroom
on the drawing-room floor. It is a little
room, but nicely furnished. He will be a great
acquisition."</p>

<p>"May I see his letter?" asked mother.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Madam, but I would rather no one
saw it. It mentions my friend, and of course my
friend would not like his name to get out, so I must
keep the letter private, but if Mr. Randolph makes
himself in any way disagreeable to you ladies I am
sure he will go immediately, but my impression is
that you will find him a great acquisition. I will
write to him to-night, and say that he can have the
accommodation he requires, and ask him to name
the day when he will arrive."</p>

<p>After this we had a great deal of talk on other
matters, and finally Jane retired to her premises,
and mother and I sat together in the beautiful
drawing-room.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Westenra," said mother, "it is done.
What do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"It has only begun, mother dear. Up to the
present I am charmed. What a treasure we have
secured in Jane."</p>

<p>"It is all very queer," said mother. "Why would
not she show us Mr., Mr.&mdash;&mdash;what was his
name, Westenra?"</p>

<p>"Randolph," I interrupted.</p>

<p>"Why would she not show us Mr. Randolph's
letter? I must say frankly that I do not like it.
The fact is, West, we are not in the position we were
in at Sumner Place, and we must be exceedingly
circumspect. You, for instance, must be distant and
cold to all the men who come here. You must be
careful not to allow any one to take liberties with
you. Ah, my child, did we do wrong to come?
Did we do wrong? It is terrible for me to feel that
you are in such an equivocal position."</p>

<p>"Oh but, mother, I am not. I assure you I can
look after myself; and then I have you with me,
and Jane Mullins is such a sturdy little body. I
am sure she will guide our ship, our new, delightful
ship, with a flowing sail into a prosperous harbour;
and I cannot see, mother, why we should not receive
a man who is a real gentleman. It is the men who
are not gentlemen who will be difficult to deal with.
Mr. Randolph will probably be a great help to us,
and for my part I am glad he is coming."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<p>"Things are exactly as I feared," said mother, and
I saw her anxious eyes look across the room as
though she were gazing at a vision which gave her
the greatest disquietude.</p>

<p>Early the next day I hung father's picture in such
a position in the drawing-room that mother could
have the eyes following her wherever she turned.
She often said that she was never comfortable, nor
quite at home, unless under the gaze of those eyes,
and we made up our minds not to mind the fact of
our new boarders asking questions about the picture,
for we were intensely proud of my father, and felt
that we could say in a few dignified words all that
was necessary, and that my dear father would in a
measure protect us in our new career.</p>

<p>Early the next week the first boarders arrived.
Three or four families came the same day. Jane
said that that was best. Jane was the one who
received them. She went into the hall and welcomed
them in her brusque tone and took them
immediately to their rooms, in each of which printed
rules of the establishment were pinned up, and
mother and I did not appear until just before dinner,
when the different boarders had assembled in the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Dress for dinner and make yourself look as nice
as you possibly can," was Jane's parting shot to me,
and I took her advice in my own way.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="s08">THE FLOUR IN THE CAKE</span></h2>

<p>"Put on the least becoming dress you have got,
Westenra," said mother.</p>

<p>"And what is that?" I asked, pausing with my
hand on the handle of mother's door.</p>

<p>"Well," said my mother, considering, "it is a
little difficult, for all your dresses are perfectly
sweet; but I think if there is one that suits you
rather less than another it is that cloudy blue with
the silver gauze over it."</p>

<p>"O mother! that is a great deal too dressy,"
I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Well, there is the pale primrose."</p>

<p>"Too dressy again."</p>

<p>"One of your many white dresses&mdash;but then you
look exquisite in white, darling."</p>

<p>"You had better leave it to me, mother," I said.
"I promise to make myself look as plain and uninteresting
and unpretentious as possible." And
then I shut the door quickly and left her.</p>

<p>The stepping down had been exciting, but the
first firm footfall on our new <i>terra firma</i> was more
exciting still. The boarders and I were to meet at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
dinner. For the first time I was to be known to
the world as Miss Wickham, who kept a boarding-house
in company with her mother and a certain
Miss Jane Mullins. It was not a high position according
to that set in which I was born. But never
mind. Just because my father had won the Victoria
Cross would his daughter think nothing degrading
which meant an honourable and honest
livelihood. So I hastily donned a black net dress
which was not too fashionable, and without any
ornament whatsoever, not even a string of pearls
round my neck, ran downstairs. But the dress
was low and the sleeves were short, and I could
not keep the crimson of excitement out of my
cheeks, nor the fire of excitement out of my eyes.
I ran into the drawing-room, exclaiming "Mother!
mother!" and forgot for the moment that the
drawing-room no longer belonged to mother and
me, but was the property of our paying guests,
and our house was no longer ours.</p>

<p>Mrs. and Miss Armstrong were standing near the
hearth. Mrs. Armstrong was a thin, meagre little
woman, of about forty years of age. Country was
written all over her&mdash;provincial country. She had
faded hair and a faded complexion, and at times,
and when not greatly excited, a faded manner.
When she was thinking of herself she was painfully
affected; when she was not thinking of herself she
was hopelessly vulgar. Her daughter was a downright
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
buxom young person, who quite held her own.
Neither Mrs. nor Miss Armstrong were in evening
dress, and they stared with amazement and indignation
at me. Miss Armstrong's cheeks became
flushed with an ugly red, but I tripped up to them
just as if there were no such thing as dress in the
world, and held out my hand.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" I said. "I am glad to see
you. Won't you both sit down? I hope you have
found everything comfortable in your room."</p>

<p>Then, as Mrs. Armstrong still stared at me, her eyes
growing big with amazement, I said in a low voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"My name is Wickham. I am one of the owners
of this house."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Wickham," said Mrs. Armstrong, and
there was a perceptible tone of relief in her voice.
It did not matter how stylish Miss Wickham looked,
she was still only Miss Wickham, a person of no
importance whatsoever.</p>

<p>"Come here, Marion," said Mrs. Armstrong, relapsing
at once into her commonest manner. "You
must not sit too near the fire, for you will get your
nose red, and that is not becoming."</p>

<p>Marion, however, drew nearer to the fire, and did
not take the least notice of her mother's remark.</p>

<p>"So you keep this boarding-house," said Mrs. Armstrong,
turning to me again. "Well, I am surprised.
Do you mind my making a blunt remark?"</p>

<p>I did not answer, but I looked quietly back at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
her. I think something in my steady gaze disquieted
her, for she uttered a nervous laugh, and
then said abruptly&mdash;</p>

<p>"You don't look the thing, you know. You're
one of the most stylish young ladies I have ever
seen. Isn't she, Marion?"</p>

<p>"She is indeed," answered Miss Marion. "I thought
she was a duchess at least when she came into the
room."</p>

<p>"Come over here, Marion, and don't stare into
the flames," was Mrs. Armstrong's next remark. "I
didn't know," she added, "we were coming to a
place of this kind. It is very gratifying to me. I
suppose the bulk of the guests here will be quite
up to your standard, Miss Wickham?"</p>

<p>"I hope so," I replied. I was spared any more
of my new boarders' intolerable remarks, for at that
moment Mrs. and Captain Furlong appeared. He
was a gentleman, and she was a lady. She was an
everyday sort of little body to look at, but had the
kindest heart in the world. She was neither young
nor old, neither handsome nor the reverse. She
was just like thousands of other women, but there
was a rest and peace about her very refreshing.
She was dressed suitably, and her husband wore
semi-evening dress.</p>

<p>I went up to them, talked a little, and showed
them some of the most comfortable chairs in the
room. We chatted on everyday matters, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
mother appeared. Dear, dear mother! Had I
done right to put her in this position? She looked
nervous, and yet she looked stately as I had never
seen her look before. I introduced her not only to
the Furlongs, who knew instinctively how to treat
her, but also to Mrs. and Miss Armstrong, and then
to a Mr. and Mrs. Cousins who appeared, and the
three Miss Frosts, and some other people, who were
all taking possession of us and our house. Oh, it
was confusing on that first night. I could scarcely
bear it myself. I had never guessed that the very
boarders would look down on us, that just because
we were ladies they would consider our position an
equivocal one, and treat us accordingly. I hoped
that by-and-by it might be all right, but now I
knew that mother and I were passing through the
most trying period of this undertaking. Some of
our guests were people of refinement, who would
know how to act and what to do under any circumstances,
and some again were of the Armstrong
type, who would be pushing and disagreeable
wherever they went. Marion Armstrong, in particular,
intended to make her presence felt. She
had a short conversation with her mother, and then
pushed her way across the room to where my own
mother sat, and stood before her and began to talk
in a loud, brusque, penetrating voice.</p>

<p>"I have not been introduced to you, Madam;
my name is Marion Armstrong. I have come up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
to London to study Art. I was rather taken aback
when I saw you. You and Miss Wickham are the
people who are our landladies, so to speak, and you
are so different from most landladies that mother
and I feel a little confused about it. Oh, thank
you; you wish to know if we are comfortable. We
are fairly so, all things considered; we don't <i>mind</i>
our attic room, but it's likely we'll have to say a
few words to your housekeeper&mdash;Miss Mullins, I
think you call her&mdash;in the morning. You doubtless,
Madam, do not care to interfere with the more
sordid part of your duties."</p>

<p>At that moment, and before my really angry
mother could answer, the door was opened, and
there entered Jane Mullins in her usual sensible,
downright silken gown, and a tall man. I glanced
at him for a puzzled moment, feeling sure that I
had seen him before, and yet not being quite certain.
He had good features, was above the medium height,
had a quiet manner and a sort of distant bearing
which would make it impossible for any one to take
liberties with him.</p>

<p>Miss Mullins brought him straight across the
room to mother and introduced him. I caught the
name, Randolph. Mother bowed, and so did he,
and then he stood close to her, talking very quietly,
but so effectively, that Miss Armstrong, after staring
for a moment, had to vanish nonplussed into a distant
corner of the drawing-room. I saw by the way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
that young lady's eyes blazed that she was now intensely
excited. Mother and I had startled and
confused her a good deal, and Mr. Randolph finished
the dazzling impression her new home was giving
her. Certainly she had not expected to see a
person of his type here. She admired him, I saw
at a glance, immensely, and now stood near her own
mother, shaking her head now and then in an
ominous manner, and whispering audibly.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jane, who was here, there, and everywhere,
whisked sharply round.</p>

<p>"Don't you know Mr. Randolph, Miss Wickham?"
she said.</p>

<p>I shook my head. She took my hand and
brought me up to mother's side.</p>

<p>"Mr. Randolph," she said, "this is our youngest
hostess, Miss Westenra Wickham."</p>

<p>Mr. Randolph bowed, said something in a cold,
courteous tone, scarcely glanced at me, and then
resumed his conversation with mother.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="s08">THE ARTIST'S EYE</span></h2>

<p>During dinner I found myself seated next Miss
Armstrong. Miss Armstrong was on one side of
me, and her mother was at the other. I don't
really know how I got placed between two such
uncongenial people, but perhaps it was good for me,
showing me the worst as well as the best of our
position at once. I was having a cold douche with
a vengeance.</p>

<p>As we were taking our soup (I may as well say
that the ménu was excellent, quite as good as
many a grand West End dinner which I had
attended in my palmy days), Miss Armstrong bent
towards me, spilling a little of her soup as she did
so, and said, in a somewhat audible whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wish you would give me a hint about him."</p>

<p>"About whom?" I asked in return.</p>

<p>"Mr. Randolph; he is one of the most stylish
people I have ever met. What are his tastes?
Don't you know anything at all about him? Is he
married, for instance?"</p>

<p>"I never saw Mr. Randolph before, and I know
nothing about him," I answered in a low, steady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
voice, which was in marked contrast to Miss Armstrong's
buzzing, noisy whisper.</p>

<p>"Oh my!" said that young lady, returning again
to the contemplation of her soup. Her plate was
taken away, and in the interval she once more led
the attack.</p>

<p>"He <i>is</i> distingué," she said, "quite one of the
upper ten. I wish you <i>would</i> tell me where you
met him before. You must have met him before,
you know; he would not come to a house like this
if he was not interested in you and your mother.
He is a very good-looking man; I admire him
myself immensely."</p>

<p>"I don't care to make personal remarks at dinner,"
I said, looking steadily at the young lady.</p>

<p>"Oh my!" she answered again to this; but as
some delicious turbot was now facing her, she began
to eat it, and tried to cover her mortification.</p>

<p>Presently my neighbour to my right began to
speak, and Mrs. Armstrong's manners were only a
shade more intolerable than her daughter's.</p>

<p>"Marion has come up to London to study h'Art,"
she said. She uttered the last word in a most
emphatic tone. "Marion has a great taste for h'Art,
and she wants to attend one of the schools and
become an h'artist. Do you think you could give
us any advice on the subject, Miss Wickham?"</p>

<p>I answered gently that I had never studied Art
myself, having no leaning in that direction.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh dear: now I should have said you had the
h'artist's h'eye," said Mrs. Armstrong, glancing at
my dress and at the way my hair was arranged as
she spoke. "You are very stylish, you know; you
are a good-looking girl, too, very good-looking. You
don't mind me giving you a plain compliment, do
you, my dear?"</p>

<p>I made no reply, but my cheeks had never felt
more hot, nor I myself more uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Mrs. Armstrong looked me all over again, then
she nodded across my back at Miss Armstrong, and
said, still in her buzzing half-whisper, for the benefit
of her daughter&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Wickham has got the h'artist's h'eye, and
she'll help us fine, after she's got over her first
amazement. She's new to this business any one
can see; but, Marion, by-and-by you might ask her
if she would lend you that bodice to take the pattern.
I like the way it is cut so much. You have got a
good plump neck, and would look well in one made
like it."</p>

<p>Marion's answer to this was, "O mother, do
hush;" and thus the miserable meal proceeded.</p>

<p>I was wondering how my own mother was getting
on, and at last I ventured to glance in her direction.
She was seated at the head of the table, really
doing nothing in the way of carving, for the dishes,
except the joints, were all handed round, and the
joints Jane Mullins managed, standing up to them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
and carving away with a rapidity and <i>savoir faire</i>
which could not but arouse my admiration. The
upper part of the table seemed to be in a very
peaceful condition, and I presently perceived that
Mr. Randolph led the conversation. He was having
an argument on a subject of public interest with
Captain Furlong, and Captain Furlong was replying,
and Mr. Randolph was distinctly but in very firm
language showing the worthy captain that he was
in the wrong, and Mrs. Furlong was laughing, and
mother was listening with a pleased flush on her
cheeks. After all the dear mother was happy, she
was not in the thick of the storm, she was not
assailed by two of the most terrible women it had
ever been my lot to encounter.</p>

<p>The meal came to an end, and at last we left
the room.</p>

<p>"Stay one minute behind, dear," said Jane Mullins
to me.</p>

<p>I did so. She took me into her tiny little parlour
on the ground floor.</p>

<p>"Now then, Miss Wickham, what's the matter?
You just look as if you were ready to burst into
tears. What's up? Don't you think our first dinner
was very successful&mdash;a good long table all surrounded
with people pleased with their dinner, and in high
good humour, and you were the cause of the success,
let me tell you, dear. They will talk of you right
and left. This boarding-house will never be empty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
from this night out, mark my words; and I never
was wrong yet in a matter of plain common-sense."</p>

<p>"But oh, dear!" I cried, and I sank into a chair,
and I am sure the tears filled my eyes; "the
company are so mixed, Miss Mullins, so terribly
mixed."</p>

<p>"It takes a lot of mixing to make a good cake,"
was Jane's somewhat ambiguous answer.</p>

<p>"Now, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, any one can see with half an eye that you
object to Mrs. and Miss Armstrong, and I will own
they are not the sort of folks a young lady like
yourself is accustomed to associate with; but all the
same, if we stay here and turn this house into a
good commercial success, we must put up with those
sort of people, they are, so to speak, the support of
an establishment of this sort. I call them the flour
of the cake. Now, flour is not interesting stuff, at
least uncombined with other things; but you cannot
make a cake without it. People of that sort will go
to the attics, and if we don't let the attics, my dear
Miss Wickham, the thing won't pay. Every attic
in the place must be let, and to people who will pay
their weekly accounts regularly, and not run up
bills. It's not folks like your grand Captain Furlong,
nor even like Mr. Randolph, who make these sort of
places 'hum,' so to speak. This establishment shall
<i>hum</i>, my dear, and hum right merrily, and be one
of the most popular boarding-houses in London.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
But you leave people like the Armstrongs to me.
To-morrow you shall sit right away from them."</p>

<p>"No, I will not," I said stoutly, "why should you
have all the burden, and mother and I all the
pleasure? You are brave, Miss Mullins."</p>

<p>"If you love me, dear, call me Jane, I can't bear
the name of Mullins. From the time I could speak
I hated it, and three times in my youth I hoped to
change it, and three times was I disappointed. The
first man jilted me, dear, and the second died, and
the third went into an asylum. I'm Mullins now,
and Mullins I'll be to the end. I never had much
looks to boast of, and what I had have gone, so
don't fret me with the knowledge that I am an old
maid, but call me Jane."</p>

<p>"Jane you shall be," I said. She really was a
darling, and I loved her.</p>

<p>I found after my interview with Jane that the
time in the drawing-room passed off extremely well,
and this I quickly discovered was owing to Mr.
Randolph, who, without making the smallest effort
to conciliate the Armstrongs, or the Cousinses, or
any of the other <i>attic strata</i>, as Jane called them,
kept them all more or less in order. He told a few
good stories for the benefit of the company, and then
he sat down to the piano and sang one or two songs.
He had a nice voice, not brilliant, but sweet and a
real tenor, and he pronounced his words distinctly,
and every one could listen, and every one did listen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
with pleasure. As to Mrs. and Miss Armstrong they
held their lips apart in their amazement and delight.
Altogether, I felt that Mr. Randolph had made the
evening a success, and that without him, notwithstanding
Jane's cheery words, the thing would have
been an absolute failure.</p>

<p>Just towards the close of the evening he came up
to my side.</p>

<p>"I must congratulate you," he said.</p>

<p>"On what?" I answered somewhat bitterly.</p>

<p>"On your delightful home, on your bravery." He
gave me a quick glance, which I could not understand,
which I did not understand until many months
afterwards. I was not sure at that moment whether
he was laughing at me or whether he was in earnest.</p>

<p>"I have something to thank you for," I said after
a moment, "it was good of you to entertain our
guests, but you must not feel that you are obliged
to do so."</p>

<p>He looked at me then again with a grave and
not easily comprehended glance.</p>

<p>"I assure you," he said slowly, "I never do anything
I don't like. Pray don't thank me for exactly
following my own inclinations. I was in the humour
to sing, I sing most nights wherever I am. If you
object to my singing pray say so, but do not condemn
me to silence in the future, particularly as you have
a very nice piano."</p>

<p>"You look dreadfully out of place in this house,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
was my next remark; and then I said boldly, "I
cannot imagine why you came."</p>

<p>"I wonder if that is a compliment, or if it is not,"
said Mr. Randolph. "I do not believe I look more
out of place here than you do, but it seems to me
that neither of us are out of place, and that the
house suits us very well. I like it; I expect I shall
be extremely comfortable. Jane Mullins is an old
friend of mine. I always told her, that whenever
she set up a boarding-house I would live with her.
For instance, did you ever eat a better dinner than
you had to-night?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," I answered, "I don't care much
about dinners, but it seemed good, at least it satisfied
every one."</p>

<p>"Now I am a hopeless epicure," he said slowly.
"I would not go anywhere if I was not sure that
the food would be of the very best. No, Miss Wickham,
I am afraid, whether you like it or not, you
cannot get rid of me at present; but I must not
stand talking any longer. I promised to lend your
mother a book, it is one of Whittier's, I will fetch it."</p>

<p>He left the room, came back with the book in
question, and sat down by mother's side. He
was decidedly good-looking, and most people would
have thought him charming, but his manner to
me puzzled me a good deal, and I was by no means
sure that I liked him. He had grey eyes, quite
ordinary in shape and colour, but they had a wonderfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
quizzical glance, and I felt a sort of fear,
that when he seemed to sympathise he was laughing
at me; I also felt certain that I had seen him before.
Who was he? How was it possible that a man of
his standing should have anything to do with Jane
Mullins, and yet they were excellent friends. The
little woman went up to him constantly in the course
of the evening, and asked his advice on all sorts of
matters. What did it mean? I could not understand
it!</p>

<p>We took a few days settling down, and during
that time the house became full. It was quite true
that Mrs. Armstrong talked of us to her friends.
The next day, indeed, she took a complete survey
of the house accompanied by Jane; making frank
comments on all she saw, complaining of the high
prices, but never for a moment vouchsafing to give
up her large front attic, which was indeed a bedroom
quite comfortable enough for any lady. She must
have written to her friends in the country, for other
girls somewhat in appearance like Marion Armstrong
joined our family circle, sat in the drawing-room in
the evening, talked <i>at</i> Mr. Randolph, and looked at
him with eager, covetous eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. Randolph was perfectly polite to these young
ladies, without ever for a single moment stepping
down from his own pedestal. Marion Armstrong,
poke as she would, could not discover what his special
tastes were. When she questioned him, he declared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
that he liked everything. Music?&mdash;certainly, he
adored music. Art?&mdash;yes, he did sketch a little.
The drama?&mdash;he went to every piece worth seeing,
and generally on first nights. The opera?&mdash;he
owned that a friend of his had a box for the season,
and that he sometimes gave him a seat in it.</p>

<p>Miss Armstrong grew more and more excited. She
perfectly worried me with questions about this man.
Where did he come from? Who was he? What
was his profession? Did I think he was married!
Had he a secret care? Was he laughing at us?</p>

<p>Ah, when she asked me the last question, I found
myself turning red.</p>

<p>"You know something about him, and you don't
choose to tell it," said Marion Armstrong then, and
she turned to Mrs. Cousins' daughter, who had come
up to town with a view of studying music, and they
put their heads together, and looked unutterable
things.</p>

<p>Before we had been a fortnight in the place, all
the other girls vied with me as to their dinner
dress. They wore low dresses, with short sleeves,
and gay colours, and their hair was fantastically
curled, and they all glanced in the direction where
Mr. Randolph sat.</p>

<p>What hopes they entertained with regard to him
I could never divine, but he seemed to be having the
effect which Jane desired, and the attics were filling
delightfully.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<p>Jane whispered to me at the end of the second
week, that she feared she had made a great
mistake.</p>

<p>"Had I known that Mr. Randolph would have the
effect he seems to be having," she said, "I might
have doubled our prices from the very beginning,
but it is quite too late now."</p>

<p>"But why should it be necessary for us to make
so much money?" I said.</p>

<p>Jane looked at me with a queer expression.</p>

<p>"So <i>much</i>!" she said. "Oh, we shall do, I am
certain we shall do; but I am particularly anxious
not to touch that seven thousand pounds capital;
at least not much of it. I want the house to
pay, and although it is a delightful house, and
there are many guests coming and going, and it promises
soon to be quite full, yet it must remain full
all through the year, except just, of course, in the
dull season, if it is to pay well. We might have
charged more from the beginning; I see it now, but
it is too late."</p>

<p>She paused, gazed straight before her, and then
continued.</p>

<p>"We must get more people of the Captain Furlong
type," she said. "I shall advertise in the
<i>Morning Post</i>, and the <i>Standard</i>; I will also advertise
in the <i>Guardian</i>. Advertisements in that paper are
always regarded as eminently respectable. We ought
to have some clergymen in the house, and some nice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
unmarried ladies, who will take rooms and settle
down, and give a sort of religious respectable tone.
We cannot have too many Miss Armstrongs about;
there were six to dinner last night, and they rather
overweighted the scale. Our cake will be heavy if
we put so much flour into it."</p>

<p>I laughed, and counselled Jane to advertise as
soon as possible, and then ran away to my own
room. I felt if this sort of thing went on much
longer, if the girls of the Armstrong type came in
greater and greater numbers, and if they insisted
on wearing all the colours of the rainbow at dinner,
and very low dresses and very short sleeves, I must
take to putting on a high dress without any ornaments
whatsoever, and must request mother to do
likewise.</p>

<p>Miss Armstrong was already attending an Art
school, where, I cannot remember, I know it was
not the Slade; and on bringing back some of her
drawings, she first of all exhibited them to her
friends, and then left them lying on the mantelpiece
in the drawing-room, evidently in the hopes
of catching Mr. Randolph's eye. She did this every
evening for a week without any result, but at the
end of that time he caught sight of a frightfully
out-of-drawing charcoal study. It was the sort of
thing which made you feel rubbed the wrong way
the moment you glanced at it. It evidently rubbed
him the wrong way, but he stopped before it as if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
fascinated, raised his eyebrows slightly, and looked
full into Miss Armstrong's blushing face.</p>

<p>"You are the artist?" he said.</p>

<p>"I am," she replied; "it is a little study." Her
voice shook with emotion.</p>

<p>"I thought so," he said again; "may I congratulate
you?" He took up the drawing, looked at it with
that half-quizzical, half-earnest glance, which puzzled
not only Miss Armstrong and her friends but also myself,
and then put it quietly back on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"If you leave it there, it will get dusty and be
spoiled," he said. "Is it for sale?" he continued,
as if it were an after-thought.</p>

<p>"Oh no, sir," cried Miss Armstrong, half abashed
and delighted. "It is not worth any money&mdash;at
least I fear it is not."</p>

<p>"But I am so glad you like it, Mr. Randolph,"
said Mrs. Armstrong, now pushing vigorously to
the front; "I always did say that Marion had the
h'artist's soul. It shines out of her eyes, at least I
am proud to think so; and Marion, my dear, if the
good gentleman would <i>like</i> the little sketch, I am
sure you would be pleased to give it to him."</p>

<p>"But I could not think of depriving Miss Armstrong
of her drawing," said Mr. Randolph, immediately
putting on his coldest manner. He crossed
the room and seated himself near mother.</p>

<p>"There now, ma, you have offended him," said
Marion, nearly crying with vexation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="s08">HER GRACE OF WILMOT</span></h2>

<p>On a certain morning, between twelve and one
o'clock, the inhabitants of Graham Square must
have felt some slight astonishment as a carriage
and pair of horses dashed up to No. 17. On the
panels of the carriage were seen the coronet, with
the eight strawberries, which denotes the ducal
rank. The coachman and footman were also in the
well-known livery of the Duke of Wilmot. One of
the servants got down, rang the bell, and a moment
later the Duchess swept gracefully into the drawing-room,
where mother and I happened to be alone.
She came up to us with both hands outstretched.</p>

<p>"My dears," she said, glancing round, "are they
all out?"</p>

<p>"I am so glad to see you, Victoria," replied
mother; "but whom do you mean? Sit down,
won't you?"</p>

<p>The Duchess sank into the nearest chair. She
really looked quite nervous.</p>

<p>"Are the boarders out?" she said again; "I could
not encounter them. I considered the whole question,
and thought that at this hour they would, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
all probability, be shopping or diverting themselves
in some way. Ah, Westenra, let me look at you."</p>

<p>"But do you really want to look at me, Duchess?"
I asked somewhat audaciously.</p>

<p>"I see you have lost none of your spirit," said the
Duchess, and she patted me playfully with a large
fan which she wore at her side. "There, sit down
in that little chair opposite, and tell me all about
everything. How is this&mdash;this curious concern
going?"</p>

<p>"You can see for yourself," I answered; "this
room is not exactly an attic, is it?"</p>

<p>"No, it is a very nice reception-room," said the
Duchess, glancing approvingly around her. "It has,
my dear Mary&mdash;forgive me for the remark&mdash;a little
of the Mayfair look; a large room, too, nearly as
large as our rooms in Grosvenor Place."</p>

<p>"Not quite as large," I replied, "and it is not
like your rooms, Duchess, but it does very well for
us, and it is certainly better and more stimulating
than a cottage in the country."</p>

<p>"Ah, Westenra, you are as terribly independent
as ever," said the Duchess. "What the girls of the
present day are coming to!" She sighed as she spoke.</p>

<p>"But you are a very pretty girl all the same,"
she continued, giving me an approving nod. "Yes,
yes, and this phase will pass, of course it will pass."</p>

<p>"Why have you come to see us to-day, Victoria?"
asked my mother.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear friend," replied the Duchess, dropping
her voice, "I have come to-day because I am
devoured with curiosity. I mean to drop in occasionally.
Just at present, and while the whole incident
is fresh in the minds of our friends, you would
scarcely like me to ask you to my receptions, but
by-and-by I doubt not it can be managed. The
fact is, I admire you both, and very often think of
you. The Duke also is greatly tickled at the whole
concern; I never saw him laugh so heartily about
anything. He says that, as to Westenra, she is
downright refreshing; he never heard of a girl of
her stamp doing this sort of thing before. He
thinks that she will make a sort of meeting-place,
a sort of bond between the West and the&mdash;the&mdash;no,
not the East, but this sort of neutral ground
where the middle-class people live."</p>

<p>The Duchess looked round the big room, and
then glanced out at the Square.</p>

<p>"Harrison had some difficulty in finding the
place," she said, "but the British Museum guided
him; it is a landmark. Even we people of Mayfair
go to the British Museum sometimes. It is colossal
and national, and you live close to it. Do you often
study there, Westenra? Don't go too often, for
stooping over those old books gives girls such a
poke. But you really look quite comfortable here."</p>

<p>"We are delightfully comfortable," I said. "We
enjoy our lives immensely."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<p>"It is very nice to see you, Victoria," said mother.</p>

<p>Then I saw by the look on mother's face that
while I had supposed her to be perfectly happy, all
this time she had been more or less suffering. She
had missed the people of her own kind. The
Duchess looked her all over.</p>

<p>"You are out of your element here, Mary," she
said, "and so is this child. It is a preposterous
idea, a sort of freak of nature. I never thought
Westenra would become odd; she bids fair to be
very odd. I don't agree with the Duke. I don't
care for odd people, they don't marry well as a rule.
Of course there are exceptions. I said so to the
Duke when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When what?" I said, seeing that she paused.</p>

<p>"Nothing, my love, nothing. I have come here,
Westenra, to let you and your mother know that
whenever you like to step up again I will give you a
helping hand."</p>

<p>"Oh, we are never going back to the old life," I
said. "We could not afford it, and I don't know
either that we should care to live as we did&mdash;should
we, Mummy? We know our true friends now."</p>

<p>"That is unkind, my child. The fact is, it is
the idea of the <i>boarding-house</i> that all your friends
shrink from. If you and your mother had taken a
nice house in the country, not a large and expensive
house, but a fairly respectable one, with a little
ground round, I and other people I know might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
have got ladies to live with you and to pay you
well. Our special friends who wanted change and
quiet might have been very glad to go to you for
two or three weeks, but you must see for yourselves,
both of you, that this sort of thing is impossible.
Nevertheless, I came here to-day to say that whenever,
Westenra, you step up, you will find your old
friend&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And godmother," I said.</p>

<p>"And godmother," she repeated, "willing to give
you a helping hand."</p>

<p>"When you became my godmother," I said
slowly (oh, I know I was very rude, but I could
not quite help myself), "you promised for me, did
you not, that I should not love the world?"</p>

<p>The Duchess gazed at me out of her round, good-humoured
brown eyes.</p>

<p>"We all know just what that means," she said.</p>

<p>"No, we do not," I answered. "I think very few
people do know or realise it in the very least. Now
stepping back again might mean the world; perhaps
mother and I would rather stay where we are."</p>

<p>As I spoke I got up impatiently and walked to
one of the windows, and just then I saw Mr.
Randolph coming up the steps. As a rule he was
seldom in to lunch; he was an erratic individual,
always sleeping in the house, and generally some
time during the day having a little chat with
mother, but for the rest he was seldom present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
at any of our meals except late dinner. Why was
he coming to lunch to-day? I heard his step on
the stairs, he had a light, springy step, the drawing-room
door opened and he came in.</p>

<p>"Ah, Jim," said the Duchess, "I scarcely expected
to see you here."</p>

<p>She got up and held out her hand; he grasped it.
I thought his face wore a peculiar expression. I am
not quite certain about this, for I could not see him
very well from where I was standing, but I did
notice that the Duchess immediately became on her
guard. She dropped his hand and turned to mother.</p>

<p>"I met Mr. Randolph last year in Italy," she said.</p>

<p>Mother now entered into conversation with them
both, and I stood by the window looking out into the
square, and wondering why the Duchess had coloured
when she saw him. Why had she called him Jim?
If she only met him last year abroad it was scarcely
likely that she would be intimate enough to speak
to him by his Christian name. A moment later
she rose.</p>

<p>"You may take me down to my carriage, Jim,"
she said. "Good-bye, Westenra; you are a naughty
girl, full of defiance, and you think your old godmother
very unkind, but whenever you step up I shall
be waiting to help you. Good-bye, good-bye. Oh
hurry, please, Mr. Randolph, some of those creatures
may be coming in. Good-bye, dear, good-bye."</p>

<p>She nodded to mother, laid her hand lightly on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
Mr. Randolph's arm, who took her down and put
her into her carriage. They spoke together for a
moment, I watched them from behind the drawing-room
curtains, then the carriage rolled away, and
the square was left to its usual solid respectability.
Doctors' carriages did occasionally drive through it,
and flourishing doctors drove a pair of horses as often
as not, but the strawberry on the panels showed
itself no more for many a long day in that region.</p>

<p>At lunch the boarders were in a perfect state of
ferment. Even Captain and Mrs. Furlong were
inclined to be subservient. Did we really know the
Duchess of Wilmot? Captain Furlong was quite
up in the annals of the nobility. This was one of
his little weaknesses, for he was quite in every sense
of the word a gentleman; but he did rather air his
knowledge of this smart lady and of that whom
he had happened to meet in the course of his
wanderings.</p>

<p>"There are few women I admire more than the
Duchess of Wilmot," he said to mother, "she is
so charitable, so good. She was a Silchester, you
know, she comes of a long and noble line. For my
part, I believe strongly in heredity. Have you
known the Duchess long, Mrs. Wickham?"</p>

<p>"All my life," answered mother simply.</p>

<p>"Really! All your life?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, "we were brought up in the
same village."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

<p>The servant came up with vegetables, and mother
helped herself. Captain Furlong looked a little more
satisfied.</p>

<p>Mrs. Armstrong gave me a violent nudge in the
side.</p>

<p>"I suppose your mother was the clergyman's
daughter?" she said. "The great people generally
patronise the daughters of the clergy in the places
where they live. I have often noticed it. I said so
to Marion last night. I said, if only, Marion, you
could get into that set, you would begin to know
the upper ten, clergymen are so respectable; but
Marion, if you'll believe it, will have nothing to do
with them. She says she would not be a curate's
wife for the world. What I say is this, she wouldn't
always be a curate's wife, for he would be sure to
get a living, and if he were a smart preacher, he
might be a dean by-and-by, or even a bishop, just
think of it. But Marion shuts her eyes to all these
possibilities, and says that nothing would give her
greater torture than teaching in Sunday-school and
having mothers' meetings. With her h'artistic soul I
suppose it is scarcely to be expected that she should
take to that kind of employment. And your mother
was the clergyman's daughter, was she not?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered. I did not add any more. I
did not repeat either that the Duchess happened to
be my godmother. I turned the conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. Randolph sat near mother and talked to her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
and soon other things occupied the attention of the
boarders, and the Duchess's visit ceased to be the
topic of conversation.</p>

<p>On the next evening but one, Mr. Randolph came
to my side.</p>

<p>"I heard your mother say, Miss Wickham, that
you are both fond of the theatre. Now I happen
to have secured, through a friend, three tickets for
the first night of Macbeth. I should be so glad if
you would allow me to take you and Mrs. Wickham
to the Lyceum."</p>

<p>"And I should like it, Westenra," said mother&mdash;she
came up while he was speaking. Miss Armstrong
happened to be standing near, and I am sure she
overheard. Her face turned a dull red, she walked
a step or two away. I thought for a moment. I
should have greatly preferred to refuse; I was beginning,
I could not tell why, to have an uneasy
feeling with regard to Mr. Randolph&mdash;there was a
sort of mystery about his staying in the house, and
why did the Duchess know him, and why did she
call him Jim. But my mother's gentle face and the
longing in her eyes made me reply&mdash;</p>

<p>"If mother likes it, of course I shall like it.
Thank you very much for asking us."</p>

<p>"I hope you will enjoy it," was his reply, "I am
glad you will come." He did not allude again to
the matter, but talked on indifferent subjects. We
were to go to the Lyceum on the following evening.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<p>The next day early I went into mother's room.
Mother was not at all as strong as I could have
wished. She had a slight cough, and there was a
faded, fagged sort of look about her, a look I had
never seen when we lived in Mayfair. She was
subject to palpitations of the heart too, and often
turned quite faint when she went through any
additional exertion. These symptoms had begun
soon after our arrival at 17 Graham Square. She
had never had them in the bygone days, when her
friends came to see her and she went to see them.
Was mother too old for this transplanting? Was
it a little rough on her?</p>

<p>Thoughts like these made me very gentle whenever
I was in my dear mother's presence, and I was
willing and longing to forget myself, if only she
might be happy.</p>

<p>"What kind of day is it, Westenra?" she said
the moment I put in an appearance. She was not
up yet, she was lying in bed supported by pillows.
Her dear, fragile beautiful face looked something
like the most delicate old porcelain. She was
sipping a cup of strong soup, which Jane Mullins
had just sent up to her.</p>

<p>"O Mummy!" I said, kissing her frantically,
"are you ill? What is the matter?"</p>

<p>"No, my darling, I am quite as well as usual,"
she answered, "a little weak, but that is nothing.
I am tired sometimes, Westenra."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>"Tired, but you don't do a great deal," I said.</p>

<p>"That's just it, my love, I do too little. If I had
more to do I should be better."</p>

<p>"More visiting, I suppose, and that sort of thing?"
I said.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered very gently, "more visiting,
more variety, more exchange of ideas&mdash;if it were
not for Mr. Randolph."</p>

<p>"You like him?" I said.</p>

<p>"Don't you, my darling?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, mother, I am not sure about him.
Who is he?"</p>

<p>"A nice gentlemanly fellow."</p>

<p>"Mother, I sometimes think he is other than what
he seems, we know nothing whatever about him."</p>

<p>"He is a friend of Jane Mullins's," said mother.</p>

<p>"But, mother, how can that be? He is not
really a friend of Jane Mullins's. Honest little Jane
belongs essentially to the people. You have only to
look from one face to the other to see what a wide
gulf there is between them. He is accustomed to
good society; he is a man of the world. Mother,
I am certain he is keeping something to himself.
I cannot understand why he lives here. Why
should he live here?"</p>

<p>"He likes it," answered mother. "He enjoys his
many conversations with me. He likes the neighbourhood.
He says Bloomsbury is far more healthy
than Mayfair."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<p>"Mother, dear, is it likely that such a man
would think much about his health."</p>

<p>"I am sorry you are prejudiced against him," said
mother, and a fretful quaver came into her voice.
"Well," she added, "I am glad the day is fine, we
shall enjoy our little expedition this evening."</p>

<p>"But are you sure it won't be too much for you?"</p>

<p>"Too much! I am so wanting to go," said mother.</p>

<p>"Then that is right, and I am delighted."</p>

<p>"By the way," continued mother, "I had a note
this morning from Mr. Randolph; he wants us to
dine with him first at the Hotel Cecil."</p>

<p>"Mother!"</p>

<p>"Yes, darling; is there any objection?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't like it," I continued; "why should
we put ourselves under an obligation to him?"</p>

<p>"I do not think, Westenra, you need be afraid; if
I think it right to go you need have no scruples."</p>

<p>"Of course I understand that," I answered, "and
if it were any one else I should not think twice about
it. If the Duchess, for instance, asked us to dine
with her, and if she took us afterwards to the
theatre I should quite rejoice, but I am puzzled
about Mr. Randolph."</p>

<p>"Prejudiced, you mean, dear; but never mind, you
are young. As long as you have me with you, you
need have no scruples. I have written a line to him
to say that we will be pleased to dine with him.
He is to meet us at the hotel, and is sending a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
carriage for us here. I own I shall be very glad
once in a way to eat at a table where Mrs. Armstrong
is not."</p>

<p>"I have always tried to keep Mrs. Armstrong out
of your way, mother."</p>

<p>"Yes, darling; but she irritates me all the same.
However, she is a good soul, and I must learn to
put up with her. Now then, West, what will you
wear to-night?"</p>

<p>"Something very quiet," I answered.</p>

<p>"One of your white dresses."</p>

<p>"I have only white silk, that is too much."</p>

<p>"You can make it simpler; you can take away
ornaments and flowers. I want to see you in white
again. I am perfectly tired of that black dress which
you put on every evening."</p>

<p>I left mother soon afterwards, and the rest of the
day proceeded in the usual routine. I would not
confess even to myself that I was glad I was going
to the Lyceum with Mr. Randolph and mother, but
when I saw a new interest in her face and a brightness
in her voice, I tried to be pleased on her
account. After all, she was the one to be considered.
If it gave her pleasure it was all as it
should be.</p>

<p>When I went upstairs finally to dress for this
occasion, which seemed in the eyes of Jane Mullins
to be a very great occasion, she (Jane) followed me
to my door. I heard her knock on the panels, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
told her to come in with some impatience in my
voice.</p>

<p>"Now that is right," she said; "I was hoping you
would not put on that dismal black. Young things
should be in white."</p>

<p>"Jane," I said, turning suddenly round and speaking
with great abruptness, "what part of the cake
do you suppose Mr. Randolph represents?"</p>

<p>Jane paused for a moment; there came a twinkle
into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, now," she said, "I should like to ask you
that question myself, say in a year's time."</p>

<p>"I have asked it of you now," I said; "answer,
please."</p>

<p>"Let's call him the nutmeg," said Jane. "We
put nutmeg into some kinds of rich cake. It strikes
me that the cake of this establishment is becoming
very rich and complicated now. It gives a rare
flavour, does nutmeg, used judiciously."</p>

<p>"I know nothing about it," I answered with impatience.
"What part of the cake is mother?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the ornamental icing," said Jane at once;
"it gives tone to the whole."</p>

<p>"And I, Jane, I?"</p>

<p>"A dash of spirit, which we put in at the end to give
the subtle flavour," was Jane's immediate response.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jane, you are very complimentary."</p>

<p>"To return to your dress, dear, I am glad you are
wearing white."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p>"I am putting on white to please mother," I
replied, "otherwise I should not wear it. To tell
the truth, I never felt less disposed for an evening's
amusement in my life."</p>

<p>"Then that is extremely wrong of you, Westenra.
They are all envying you downstairs. As to poor
Miss Armstrong, she would give her eyes to go.
They are every one of them in the drawing-room,
and dressed in their showiest, and it has leaked out
that you won't be there, nor Mrs. Wickham, nor&mdash;nor
Mr. Randolph, and that I'll be the only one to keep
the place in order to-night. I do trust those attic
boarders won't get the better of me, for I have a
spice of temper in me when I am roused, and those
attics do rouse me sometimes almost beyond endurance.
As I said before, we get too much of the
attic element in the house, and if we don't look
sharp the cake will be too heavy."</p>

<p>"That would never do," I replied. I was hurriedly
fastening on my white dress as I spoke. It was of
a creamy shade, and hung in graceful folds, and I
felt something like the Westenra of old times as I
gathered up my fan and white gloves, and wrapped
my opera cloak round me. I was ready. My dress
was simplicity itself, but it suited me. I noticed
how slim and tall I looked, and then ran downstairs,
determined to forget myself and to devote
the whole evening to making mother as happy as
woman could be.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>Mother was seated in the drawing-room, looking
stately, a little nervous, and very beautiful. The
ladies of the establishment were fussing round her.
They had already made her into a sort of queen,
and she certainly looked regal to-night.</p>

<p>The servant came up and announced that the
carriage was waiting. We went downstairs. It
was a little brougham, dull chocolate in colour. A
coachman in quiet livery sat on the box; a footman
opened the door for us. The brougham was drawn
by a pair of chestnuts.</p>

<p>"Most unsuitable," I murmured to myself. "What
sort of man is Mr. Randolph?"</p>

<p>Mother, however, looked quite at home and happy
in the little brougham. She got in, and we drove
off. It was now the middle of November, and I
am sure several faces were pressed against the glass
of the drawing-room windows as we were whirled
rapidly out of the Square.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="s08">WHY DID HE DO IT?</span></h2>

<p>Mr. Randolph had engaged a private room at the
hotel. We sat down three to dinner. During the
first pause I bent towards him and said in a semi-whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why did you send that grand carriage for
us?"</p>

<p>"Did it annoy you?" he asked, slightly raising
his brows, and that quizzical and yet fascinating
light coming into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied. "It was unsuitable."</p>

<p>"I do not agree with you, Westenra," said mother.</p>

<p>"It was unsuitable," I continued. "When we
stepped into our present position we meant to stay
in it. Mr. Randolph humiliates us when he sends
unsuitable carriages for us."</p>

<p>"It happened to be my friend's carriage," he
answered simply. "He lent it to me&mdash;the friend
who has also given me tickets for the Lyceum. I am
sorry. I won't transgress again in the same way."</p>

<p>His tone did not show a trace of annoyance, and
he continued to speak in his usual tranquil fashion.</p>

<p>As to mother, she was leaning back in her chair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
and eating a little, a very little, of the many good
things provided, and looking simply radiant. She
was quite at home. I saw by the expression on her
face that she had absolutely forgotten the boarding-house;
the attics were as if they had never existed;
the third floor and the second floor boarders had
vanished completely from her memory. Even Jane
Mullins was not. She and I were as we used to be;
our old house in Sumner Place was still our home.
We had our own carriage, we had our own friends.
We belonged to Mayfair. Mother had forgotten
Bloomsbury, and what I feared she considered its
many trials. Mr. Randolph talked as pleasantly
and cheerfully as man could talk, keeping clear of
shoals, and conducting us into the smoothest and
pleasantest waters.</p>

<p>When dinner was over he led us to the same
unsuitable carriage and we drove to the Lyceum.
We had a very nice box on the first tier, and saw
the magnificent play to perfection. Mr. Randolph
made me take one of the front chairs, and I saw
many of my old friends. Lady Thesiger kissed her
hand to me two or three times, and at the first
curtain paid us both a brief visit.</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, "this is nice; your trial scheme
is over, Westenra, and you are back again."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind," I answered, colouring with
vexation.</p>

<p>"Introduce me to your friend, won't you?" she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
continued, looking at Mr. Randolph with a queer
half amused gaze.</p>

<p>I introduced him. Lady Thesiger entered into
conversation. Presently she beckoned me out of
the box.</p>

<p>"Come and sit with me in my box during the
next act," she said, "I have a great deal to say to
you."</p>

<p>"But I don't want to leave mother," I replied.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! that cavalier of hers, that delightful
young man, how handsome and distinguished looking
he is! will take care of her. What do you say
his name is&mdash;Randolph, Randolph&mdash;let me think, it
is a good name. Do you know anything about him?"</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever, he happens to be one of our
boarders," I replied. "He has taken a fancy to
mother, and gave us tickets and brought us to this
box to-night."</p>

<p>Jasmine looked me all over.</p>

<p>"I must say you have not at all the appearance of
a young woman who has stepped down in the social
scale," she remarked. "What a pretty dress that
is, and you have a nicer colour than ever in your
cheeks. Do you know that you are a very handsome
girl?"</p>

<p>"You have told me so before, but I detest compliments,"
was my brusque rejoinder.</p>

<p>"Oh! I can see that you are as queer and eccentric
as ever. Now I tell you what it is, it is my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
opinion that you're not poor at all, and that you are
doing all this for a freak."</p>

<p>"And suppose that were the case, what difference
would it make?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh! in that case," answered Lady Thesiger,
"your friends would simply think you eccentric,
and love you more than ever. It is the fashion to
be eccentric now, it is poverty that crushes, you
must know that."</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered with bitterness, "it is poverty
that crushes. Well, then, from that point of view
we are crushed, for we are desperately poor. But
in our present nice comfortable house, even contaminated
as we are by our paying guests, we do not
feel our poverty, for we have all the good things of
life around us, and the whole place seems very flourishing.
Why don't you come to see us, Jasmine?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid you will want me to recommend my
friends to go to you, and I really cannot, Westenra,
I cannot."</p>

<p>"But why should you not recommend them?"</p>

<p>"They will get to know that you were, that you
belonged, that you"&mdash;Jasmine stopped and coloured
high. "I cannot do it," she said, "you must not
expect it."</p>

<p>"I won't," I replied with some pride.</p>

<p>"But all the same, I will come some morning,"
she continued. "You look so nice, and Mr. Randolph
is so&mdash;by the way, what Randolph is he? I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
must find out all about him. Do question him about
the county he comes from."</p>

<p>I did not answer, and having said good-bye to
Jasmine, returned to our own box.</p>

<p>The play came to an end, and we went home.
Mother had gone up to her room. Mr. Randolph
and I found ourselves for a moment alone.</p>

<p>"This evening has done her good," he said,
glancing at me in an interrogative fashion.</p>

<p>"Are you talking of mother?" I replied.</p>

<p>"Yes, you must see how much brighter she
appeared. Do you think it did really help her?"</p>

<p>"I do not understand you," I replied; "help her?
She enjoyed it, of course."</p>

<p>"But can't you see for yourself," he continued,
and his voice was emphatic and his eyes shone
with suppressed indignation, "that your mother
is starving. She will not complain; she is one of
the best and sweetest women I have ever met, but
all the same, I am anxious about her, this life
does not suit her&mdash;not at all."</p>

<p>"I am sure you are mistaken; I do not think
mother is as miserable as you make her out to be,"
I replied. "I know, of course, she enjoyed this
evening."</p>

<p>"She must have more evenings like this," he
continued; "many more, and you must not be
angry if I try to make things pleasant for her."</p>

<p>"Mr. Randolph," I said impulsively, "you puzzle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
me dreadfully. I cannot imagine why you live with
us; you do not belong to the class of men who live
in boarding-houses."</p>

<p>"Nor do you belong to the class of girls who
keep boarding-houses," he replied.</p>

<p>"No, but circumstances have forced mother and
me to do what we do. Circumstances have not
forced you. It was my whim that we should earn
money in this way. You don't think that I was
cruel to mother. She certainly did not want to
come here, it was I who insisted."</p>

<p>"You are so young and so ignorant," he replied.</p>

<p>"Ignorant!" I cried.</p>

<p>"Yes, and very young." He spoke sadly. "You
cannot see all that this means to an older person," he
continued. "Now, do not be angry, but I have
noticed for some time that your mother wants
change. Will you try to accept any little amusements
I may be able to procure for her in a friendly
spirit? I can do much for her if it does not worry
you, but if you will not enjoy her pleasures, she will
not be happy either. Can you not understand?"</p>

<p>I looked at him again, and saw that his face was
honest and his eyes kind.</p>

<p>"May I give your mother these little pleasures?"
he continued; "she interests me profoundly. Some
day I will tell you why I have a special reason for
being interested in your mother. I cannot tell you
at present, but I do not want you to misunderstand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
me. May I make up to her in a little measure for
much that she has lost, may I?"</p>

<p>"You may," I answered; "you are kind, I am
greatly obliged to you. I will own that I was cross
for a moment&mdash;you hurt my pride; but you may
do what you like in future, my pride shall not rise
in a hurry again." I held out my hand, he took it
and wrung it. I ran upstairs, mother was sitting
before her fire. She looked sweet, and her eyes were
bright, and there was a new strength in her voice.</p>

<p>"We have had a delightful evening," she said.
"I hope you are not tired, my darling."</p>

<p>"I am quite fresh," I answered. "I am so pleased
you enjoyed it."</p>

<p>"I did, dearest; did you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and no," I answered; "but if you are happy
I am."</p>

<p>"Sit down by me, Westenra. Let us talk a little
of what has just happened."</p>

<p>I humoured her, of course. Mr. Randolph's words
had rather alarmed me. Did he see more ill-health
about mother than I had noticed? was he seriously
anxious about her? But now as she sat there she
seemed well, very well, not at all tired, quite cheerful,
and like her own self. She took my hand.</p>

<p>Jane&mdash;dear, active, industrious Jane&mdash;had gone
early to bed, but a little supper had been left ready
for mother. She tasted some of the jelly, then laid
the spoon down by her plate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<p>"You were rude to Mr. Randolph at dinner,
West," she said.</p>

<p>"I am sorry if I vexed you," I answered.</p>

<p>"But what had he done to annoy you?"</p>

<p>"I could not bear him to send that carriage. It
was so unsuitable, servants in livery and those splendid
horses; and all the boarders did stare so. It
seemed quite out of keeping with our present lot.
But never mind, Mummy, he may bring any carriage&mdash;the
Lord Mayor's, if you like&mdash;only don't look so
unhappy." I felt the tears had come into my voice,
but I took good care they should not reach my eyes.
I bent and kissed mother on her cheek.</p>

<p>"You want your old life, your dear old life," I
said, "and your old comforts. I am very happy,
and I want you to be the same. If I have made a
mistake, and you are injured by this, it will break
my heart."</p>

<p>"I am not injured at all, I am happy," she
said.</p>

<p>"You like Mr. Randolph?"</p>

<p>"I do. He belongs to the old life."</p>

<p>"Then he is no mystery to you?"</p>

<p>"I take him quite simply, as a good-natured
fellow, who has plenty of money, and is attracted by
our rather queer position," she answered, "that is
all. I don't make mysteries where none may exist."</p>

<p>"Then I will do likewise," I said cheerfully.</p>

<p>The next morning when I awoke it seemed like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
dream that we had dined at the Cecil and enjoyed
the luxury of a box at the Lyceum, that we had for
a brief time stepped back into our old existence.</p>

<p>The morning was a foggy one, one of the first bad
fogs of the season. The boarders were cross&mdash;breakfast
was not quite as luxurious as usual; even Jane
was a little late and a little put out. The boarders
were very fond of porridge, and it happened to be
slightly burnt that morning. There were discontented
looks, and even discontented words, from
more than one uninteresting individual. Then Mr.
Randolph came in, looking very fresh and neat and
pleasant, and sat down boldly in the vacant seat
near me, and began to talk about last night.
Mother never got up until after breakfast. Mrs.
Armstrong gazed at me, and Miss Armstrong tossed
her food about, and the other boarders, even the
Furlongs, cast curious glances in our direction; but
I had determined to take him at his word, and
to enjoy all the pleasures he could give us; and
as to Mr. Randolph himself, I don't believe any
one could upset his composure. He talked a good
deal about our last night's entertainment, and said
that he hoped to be able to take us to the theatre
again soon.</p>

<p>Just at that moment a shrill voice sounded in
his ears.</p>

<p>"Did I hear you say, Mr. Randolph," called out
Mrs. Armstrong from her place at the opposite side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
of the board, "that you have a large connection
with the theatrical managers?"</p>

<p>"No, you did not, Mrs. Armstrong," was his very
quiet rejoinder.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, I'm sure." Mrs Armstrong
flushed. Miss Armstrong touched her on her arm.</p>

<p>"Lor! mother, how queer of you," she said; "I
am sure Mr. Randolph said nothing of the kind.
Why, these play managers are quite a low sort of
people; I'm ashamed of you, mother."</p>

<p>"I happen to know Irving very well," said Mr.
Randolph, "and also Beerbohm Tree and Wilson
Barrett, and I do not think any of these distinguished
men of genius are a low sort of people."</p>

<p>"It is the exception that proves the rule," said
Mrs. Armstrong, glancing at her daughter and
bridling. "You should not take me up so sharp,
Marion. What I was going to say was this, Mr.
Randolph&mdash;can you or can you not get us tickets
cheap for one of the plays. We have a great hankering
to go, both me and Marion, and seeing that
we are all in this house&mdash;one family, so to speak&mdash;it
don't seem fair, do it, that <i>all</i> the favour
should go to one?"&mdash;here she cast a withering glance
at me.</p>

<p>Mr. Randolph turned and looked at me, and that
quizzical laughing light was very bright in his eyes,
then he turned towards Mrs. Armstrong, and, after
a brief pause, said gently&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>"What day would suit you best to go to the
Lyceum?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Randolph!" said Marion Armstrong in
a voice of rapture.</p>

<p>"Because if to-morrow night would be convenient
to you two ladies," he continued, "I think I can
promise you stalls. I will let you know at lunch-time."
Here he rose, gave a slight bow in the direction
of the Armstrongs, and left the room.</p>

<p>"Now I have done it, and I am glad," said Mrs.
Armstrong.</p>

<p>"I do hope, ma," continued Marion, "that he
means to come with us. I want to go just as Mrs.
Wickham and Miss Wickham went, in the brougham
with the coachman and the footman, and to have
dinner at the Cecil. It must be delightful dining
at the Cecil, Miss Wickham. They say that most
dinners there cost five pounds, is that true?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you," I replied. "Mother and I
were Mr. Randolph's guests."</p>

<p>Mrs. Armstrong looked me up and down. She
thought it best at that moment to put on a very
knowing look, and the expression of her face was
most annoying.</p>

<p>"Don't you ask impertinent questions, Marion,"
she said; "you and me must be thankful for small
mercies, and for those two stalls, even if we do go as
lone females. But I hope to goodness Mr. Randolph
won't forget about it. If he does, I'll take the liberty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
to remind him. Now be off with you, Marion, your
h'Art awaits you. What you may become if you take
pains, goodness only knows. You may be giving
tickets yourself for the theatre some day&mdash;that is, if
you develop your talents to the utmost."</p>

<p>Amongst other matters which Jane Mullins took
upon her own broad shoulders was the interviewing
of all strangers who came to inquire about the
house. She said frankly that it would never do for
me to undertake this office, and that mother was
not to be worried. She was the person to do it,
and she accordingly conducted this part of the business
as well as&mdash;I began dimly to perceive&mdash;almost
every other, for mother had next to nothing to do,
and I had still less. I almost resented my position&mdash;it
was not what I had dreamed about. I ought
to help Jane, I ought to throw myself into the
work, I ought to make things go smoothly. Dear
Jane's fagged face began to appeal less to me than
it had at first. Was I getting hardened? Was I
getting injured? I put these questions to myself
now and then, but I think without any great
seriousness&mdash;I was sure that my plan was, on the
whole, sensible, and I would not reproach myself for
what I had done.</p>

<p>On the evening of the day which followed our
visit to the Lyceum a new inmate appeared in the
drawing-room. He was a tall man, considerably
over six feet in height, very lanky and thin, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
somewhat German cast of face, pale-blue eyes, a
bald forehead, hair slightly inclined to be sandy,
an ugly mouth with broken teeth, and a long
moustache which, with all his efforts, did not conceal
this defect.</p>

<p>The new boarder was introduced to my mother
and me by Jane Mullins as Mr. Albert Fanning.
He bowed profoundly when the introduction was
made, and gave me a bold glance. At dinner I
found, rather to my annoyance, that he was placed
next to me. Jane usually put strangers next to me
at the table, as she said that it gave general satisfaction,
and helped to keep the house full.</p>

<p>"What sort of man is Mr. Fanning?" I asked as
we were going down to dinner.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about him, dear," was
her reply. "He pays well, generously, in fact&mdash;no
less than five guineas a week. He has a room on
the first floor, but not one of our largest. It is a
very good thing to have him, for we don't often let
the first floor rooms. It's the attics and third floors
that go off so quickly. I don't know anything
about him, but he seems to be somewhat of a
character."</p>

<p>I made no reply to this, but the moment we
seated ourselves at table Mr. Fanning bent towards
me, and said in a low voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think myself extremely honoured to have
made your acquaintance, Miss Wickham."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed," I answered in some surprise. "And
why, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"I have often seen you in the Park. I saw you
there last season and the season before. When I
heard that you and Mrs. Wickham had taken this
boarding-house, I made a point of securing rooms
here as quickly as possible."</p>

<p>As he said this I felt myself shrinking away from
him. I glanced in the direction of the upper part
of the table, where Mr. Randolph was talking to
mother. Mr. Fanning bent again towards me.</p>

<p>"I do not wish to say anything specially personal,"
he remarked, "but just for once I should
like to say, if I never repeat it again, that I think
you are a most enterprising, and, let me repeat, most
charming young lady."</p>

<p>The servant was helping me just then to some
bread. I turned my face away from Mr. Fanning,
but when I looked round again he must have seen
my flushed cheeks.</p>

<p>"I am a publisher," he said, lowering his voice,
which was one of his most trying characteristics
whenever he addressed me. "Most girls like to
hear about publishers and about books. Has the
writing mania seized you yet, Miss Wickham?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied, "I have not the slightest taste
for writing. I am not the least bit imaginative."</p>

<p>"Now, what a pity that is; but there is a great
deal of writing besides the imaginative type. What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
I was going to say was this, that if at any time a
small manuscript of yours were put in my way, it
would receive the most prompt and business-like
attention. I am a very business-like person. I have
an enormous connection. My place of business is in
Paternoster Row. The Row is devoted to books, as
you know. All my books are of a go-ahead stamp;
they sell by thousands. Did you ever see a publisher's
office, Miss Wickham?"</p>

<p>"No," I said.</p>

<p>"I should be most pleased to conduct you over
mine, if you liked to call some day at the Row. I
could take you there immediately after luncheon,
and show you the premises any day you liked. Eh!
Did you speak?"</p>

<p>"I am very much occupied with my mother, and
seldom or never go anywhere without her," was my
reply to this audacious proposal. I then turned my
shoulder upon my aggressive neighbour, and began
to talk frantically to a lady at my other side. She
was a dull little woman, and I could scarcely get a
word out of her. Her name was Mrs. Sampson;
she was slightly deaf, and said "Eh, eh!" to each
remark of mine. But she was a refuge from the
intolerable Mr. Fanning, and I roused myself to
be most polite to her during the remainder of
the meal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="s08">TWO EXTREMES</span></h2>

<p>Mr. Fanning followed us upstairs after dinner. I
greatly hoped that he was the sort of man who
would not often frequent the drawing-room, but I
soon perceived my mistake. He not only entered that
apartment, but attached himself as soon as possible to
my side. He was beyond doubt the most disagreeable
boarder we had yet secured. Indeed, Mrs. and Miss
Armstrong were delightful compared to him. I now
saw Miss Armstrong glance two or three times both
at him and me, and rising deliberately, I crossed the
room, and with a motion of my hand, asked him to
accompany me. I then introduced him to that young
lady. She blushed when I did so, and bridled a little.
She did not evidently think him at all objectionable.
I went back immediately to my seat near mother,
and could scarcely suppress a feeling of pleasure at
Mr. Fanning's too evident discomfiture.</p>

<p>I generally sang a couple of songs in the evening,
and I was asked, as usual, to do so to-night. My
voice was a rather sweet mezzo soprano, and I had
been well taught. I sat down before the piano, as
usual. When Mr. Randolph was in the room he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
always came and turned the pages of my music for
me, but he was not present this evening, although
he had dined with us; he had evidently gone out
immediately afterwards. Now a voice sounded in
my ears. I turned, and saw the objectionable and
irrepressible Mr. Fanning.</p>

<p>"Why did you play me that trick?" he said.</p>

<p>"What trick?" I asked. "I do not play tricks;
I do not understand you."</p>

<p>"You do understand me perfectly well. Oh,
pray do sing this song; I am sure it is charming.
It is an old English ditty, is it not?&mdash;'Begone,
Dull Care, You and I will Never Agree.' Now,
that is just my way of thinking. I hate dismal
people, and as to care, I never bother with it. To
hear such a sprightly song from your lips will be
indeed what I may call a pick-me-up."</p>

<p>I almost rose from the piano, but knowing that
such a proceeding would call public attention to
Mr. Fanning's most unpleasant remarks, I said in
a low, emphatic voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will not play for you, nor allow you to turn
my music, if you talk to me as you are now doing.
You must address me as you would any other lady,
and I will not permit what you consider compliments."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am sure I have no wish to offend. Sorry
I spoke," he said. He did not blush&mdash;I do not
think he could&mdash;but he passed his hand across his
rather ugly mouth, and gave me a peculiar glance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
out of his queer blue eyes. He then said in a
low voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Believe me, it will be my utmost endeavour to
make myself agreeable. I quite see what you mean.
You do not want folks to remark; that's it, and I
absolutely understand. But you must not play me
those sort of tricks again, you know. I really
cannot be introduced to ladies of the sort you just
gave me an introduction to."</p>

<p>"Miss Armstrong is an excellent girl," I said, "and
I shall ask her to sing when I leave the piano. She is
very talented, and has a love both for music and art."</p>

<p>I then sang my one song, enduring the odious
proximity of this most unpleasant man. I fancied I
saw a conscious expression on the faces of several of
our guests, and resolved that whatever happened,
Mr. Fanning must leave on the following day. Such
a man could not be permitted to remain in the place.</p>

<p>Later on, as I was going to bed, there came a tap
at my door. I opened it, half hoping, half fearing,
that Jane herself might have come to see me. On
the contrary, somewhat to my surprise, I saw
Mrs. Furlong. She asked me if she might come
in. I eagerly begged of her to do so, and drew a
comfortable chair forward for her acceptance.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" I said. "Do you want
to say anything special?"</p>

<p>"I do, my dear Miss Wickham," replied the lady.
"I have come for the purpose."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes?" I said in a slight tone of query.</p>

<p>"How did that objectionable man, Mr. Fanning,
get here?"</p>

<p>"I suppose he came because he wanted to," I
replied. "The house is open to any one who will
pay, and who bears a respectable character."</p>

<p>"The house ought only to be open to those who
bear agreeable characters, and know how to act as
gentlemen," replied Mrs. Furlong stoutly. "Now
my husband and I dislike that person extremely,
but after all the fact of whether we like him or not
matters but little; it is because he tries to annoy
you that we are really concerned. Would you not
rather at dinner come and sit at our end of the
table? It always seems very hard to us that you
should sit with your housekeeper, Miss Mullins, and
amongst the least nice members of the establishment."</p>

<p>"But you must please remember," I said, "that
Jane is not a housekeeper, she is one of the partners
in this concern. It is kind of you to think of me,
but I cannot do what you propose. I must help
Jane in every way in my power. You do not know
how good and true she is, and how little I really do
for her. If I sat with you we should have a regular
clique in the place, and by degrees the boarders
would go, at least those boarders who were not
included in our set."</p>

<p>"I see," answered Mrs. Furlong. "It is all most
unsuitable," she added, and she stared straight before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
her. After a moment's pause she looked at me
again.</p>

<p>"It is the queerest arrangement I ever heard of
in all my life. Don't you think you are peculiarly
unsuited to your present life?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; I hope not."</p>

<p>"You are a lady."</p>

<p>"That is my birthright. The boarding-house
cannot deprive me of it," I answered.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know all that, but the life is not suitable.
You will find it less and less suitable as time goes
on. At present you have got your mother to
protect you, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by at present I have got
my mother?" I cried. "My mother is young,
comparatively young; she is not more than three
and forty. What do you mean, Mrs. Furlong?"</p>

<p>"Oh nothing, dear," she said, colouring, "nothing
at all. One always has, you know, in this uncertain
world to contemplate the possibility of loss, but
don't think again of what I have said. The fact is
the life is quite as unsuitable for her as for you. You
are put in a position which you cannot possibly
maintain, my dear Miss Wickham. That awful
man felt to-night that he had a right to pay you
disagreeable attentions. Now is this thing to go
on? I assure you Captain Furlong and I were
quite distressed when we saw how he behaved to
you when you were at the piano."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<p>The tears rushed to my eyes.</p>

<p>"It is kind of you to sympathise with me," I
said. "I am going to speak to Jane Mullins to-morrow.
If possible Mr. Fanning must go."</p>

<p>"But there is another thing," began Mrs. Furlong.
She paused, and I saw that she was about to say
something, even more disagreeable than anything
she had yet uttered.</p>

<p>"You have your mother, of course," she continued
slowly, "but you yourself are very young, and&mdash;now
I don't want to compliment you&mdash;but you are much
nicer looking than many girls; you have quite a
different air and appearance from any other girl in
this house. Oh, I hate interfering, but your mother,
Miss Wickham, must be a particularly innocent
woman."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I mean Mr. Randolph," she answered, and she
raised her eyes and fixed them on my face.</p>

<p>"Mr. Randolph?" I said. "Surely you must
admit that he at least is a gentleman?"</p>

<p>"He is not only a gentleman, but he is more
highly born and has more money than any one else
in the house; he does not belong to the set who fill
this house at all. Why does he come? This is no
place for him. In one way it is quite as unsuitable
to have him here as it is to have a man like Mr.
Fanning here. Those two men represent opposite
extremes. People will talk."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<p>"What about?" I asked.</p>

<p>"About you, dear."</p>

<p>"They cannot. I will not permit it." Then I
said abruptly, standing up in my excitement, "After
all, I don't care whether they talk or not; I was
prepared for misunderstandings when I came here.
Mother likes Mr. Randolph; he at least shall stay."</p>

<p>"But, my child, it is not nice to be talked about;
it is never nice for a young girl. People like my
husband and myself quite understand. We know
well that you and your mother are at present out
of your right position, but others will not be so considerate.
Mr. Randolph is always here."</p>

<p>"You think," I said, stammering, "that he comes
because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She smiled, got up and kissed me.</p>

<p>"What else could he come for, Westenra?" she
said softly.</p>

<p>"He comes because&mdash;because of mother," I answered.
"He likes her; he told me so. He is anxious
about her, for he thinks she misses her old life
very much; he wants to make things easier for her.
He is a very good man, and I respect him. I don't
mind what any one says, I know in my heart he
comes here because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you do not," said Mrs. Furlong, and she
looked me full in the eyes, and I found myself
colouring and stammering.</p>

<p>"Believe me I have not intruded upon you this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
evening without cause," said the little woman. "I
talked the matter over with my husband. I would
rather Mr. Fanning were here than Mr. Randolph.
Mr. Fanning is impossible, Mr. Randolph is not. He
does not come here on account of your mother, he
comes here because he likes you. I am very sorry;
I felt I must speak; my husband agrees with me."</p>

<p>"Do not say another word now," I said. "I am sure
you mean all this kindly, but please do not say any
more now. I will think over what you have said."</p>

<p>"I will leave you then, dear," she said.</p>

<p>She went as far as the door; she was a very
kindly little woman, she was a real lady, and she
meant well, but she had hurt me so indescribably
that at that moment I almost hated her. When
she reached the door she turned and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"If ever my husband and I can help you, Miss
Wickham (but we are poor people), if ever we can
help you, we will be glad to do so. I know you are
angry with me now, but your anger won't remain, you
will see who are your true friends by-and-by."</p>

<p>She closed the door softly, and I heard her gentle
steps going downstairs. I will frankly say that I did
not go to bed for some time, that I paced indignantly
up and down my room. I hated Jane, I
hated Mr. Fanning, I still more cordially hated Mr.
Randolph at that moment. Mr. Fanning must go,
Mr. Randolph must go. I could not allow myself
to be spoken about. How intolerable of Mr. Randolph
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
to have come as he had done, to have forced
himself upon us, to have invited us to go out with
him, to have&mdash;&mdash;and then I stopped, and a great
lump rose in my throat, and I burst into tears, for
in my heart of hearts I knew well that I did
not think what he did intolerable at all, that I
respected him, and&mdash;but I did not dare to allow
my thoughts to go any further.</p>

<p>I even hated myself for being good-looking,
until I suddenly remembered that I had the same
features as my father had. He had conquered in
all the battles in which he had borne part through
his life. My face must be a good one if it was like
his. I would try to live up to the character which
my face seemed to express, and I would immediately
endeavour to get things on a different footing.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the next day at breakfast I studiously
avoided Mr. Randolph, and I equally studiously
avoided Mr. Fanning. The consequence was that,
being as it were between two fires, I had a most
uncomfortable time, for Mr. Randolph showed me
by certain glances which he threw in my direction
that he was most anxious to consult me about something,
and Mr. Fanning seemed to intercept these
glances, and to make his own most unpleasant comments
about them; and if Mr. Fanning intercepted
them, so did Mrs. and Miss Armstrong.</p>

<p>Miss Armstrong had now given up Mr. Randolph
as almost hopeless with regard to a flirtation, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
was turning her attention in the direction of Mr.
Fanning. She talked Art <i>at</i> Mr. Fanning assiduously
all during breakfast, and having learned by
some accident that he was a publisher, boldly demanded
from him if he would not like her to
illustrate some of his books. In reply to this he
gave a profound bow, and told her, with a certain
awkward jerk of his body, that he never gave orders
in advance, that he never gave orders on the score
of friendliness, that when it came to the relations
between publisher and artist he was brutal.</p>

<p>"That's the word for it, Miss Armstrong," he said,
"I am brutal when it comes to a bargain. I try to
make the very best I can for myself. I never think
of the artist at all. I want all the <i>£ s d</i> to go
into my own pocket"&mdash;and here he slapped his
waistcoat loudly, and uttered a harsh laugh, which
showed all his broken teeth in a most disagreeable
manner. Miss Armstrong and her mother seemed
to think he was excellent fun, and Mrs. Armstrong
said, with a quick glance first at Mr. Randolph and
then at me, that it was refreshing to hear any man
so frank, and that for her part she respected people
who gave themselves no h'airs.</p>

<p>Breakfast came to an end, and I sought Jane in
her sanctum.</p>

<p>"Now, Jane," I said, "you must put away your
accounts, you must cease to think of housekeeping.
You must listen to me."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it, Westenra?" she said. "Has anything
vexed you?" she continued; "sit down and
tell me all about it."</p>

<p>"Several things vex me," I answered. "Jane,
we must come to an understanding."</p>

<p>"What about?" she asked in some alarm; "an
understanding! I thought that was all arranged
when our legal agreement was drawn up."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know nothing about lawyers nor about legal
agreements," I answered; "but, Jane, there are some
things I cannot put up with, and one of them is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," she answered; "Mr. Fanning."</p>

<p>"He is horrible, hateful; he is going to make himself
most hateful to me. Jane, dear Jane, he must go."</p>

<p>Jane looked puzzled and distressed. I expected
her to say&mdash;</p>

<p>"He shall certainly go, my dear, I will tell him
that his room is required, and that he must leave
at the end of the week." But on the contrary she
sighed. After a long pause she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You want this house to be a success, I presume."</p>

<p>"I certainly do, but we cannot have it a success
on the present arrangement. Mr. Fanning must go,
and also Mr. Randolph."</p>

<p>"Mr. Randolph, Mr. James Randolph!" said
Jane, now colouring high, and a sparkle of something,
which seemed to be a curious mixture of fear
and indignation, filling her eyes. "And why should he
go? You do not know what you are talking about."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<p>"I do. He must go. Ask&mdash;ask Mrs. Furlong. They
talk about him here, these hateful people; they put
false constructions on his kindness; I know he is kind
and he is a gentleman, but he does me harm, Jane,
even as much harm as that horrible Mr. Fanning."</p>

<p>"Now, look here, Westenra Wickham," said Jane
Mullins. "Are you going to throw up the sponge, or
are you not?"</p>

<p>"Throw up the sponge! I certainly don't mean
to fail."</p>

<p>"You will do so if you send those two men out
of the house. If you cannot hold your own, whatever
men come here, you are not the girl I took
you for. As to Mr. Randolph, be quite assured that
he will never do anything to annoy you. If people
talk let them talk. When they see nothing comes
of their idle silly gossip, they will soon cease to utter
it. And as to Mr. Fanning, they will equally cease
to worry about him. If he pays he must stay, for
as it is, it is difficult to let the first-floor rooms.
People don't want to pay five guineas a week to live
in Bloomsbury, and he has a small room; and it is
a great relief to me that he should be here and pay
so good a sum for his room. The thing must be
met commercially, or I for one give it up."</p>

<p>"You, Jane, you! then indeed we shall be ruined."</p>

<p>"I don't really mean to, my dear child, I don't
mean for a single moment to desert you; but I must
say that if 17 Graham Square is to go on, it must
go on commercial principles; and we cannot send
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
our best boarders away. You ask me coolly,
just because things are a little uncomfortable for
you, you ask me to dismiss ten guineas a week, for
Mr. Randolph pays five guineas for his room, and
Mr. Fanning five guineas for his, and I don't know
any other gentleman who would pay an equal sum,
and we must have it to balance matters. What is
to meet the rent, my dear? What is to meet the
taxes? What is to meet the butcher's, the baker's,
the grocer's, the fishmonger's bills if we dismissed
our tenants. I often have a terrible fear that we
were rash to take a great expensive house like this,
and unless it is full from attic to drawing-room floor,
we have not the slightest chance of meeting our
expenses. Even then I fear!&mdash;but there I won't
croak before the time; only, Westenra, you have to
make up your mind. You can go away on a visit
if you wish to, I do not counsel this for a moment,
for I know you are a great attraction here. It is
because you are pretty and wear nice dresses, and
look different from the other boarders, that you
attract them; and&mdash;yes, I will say it&mdash;Mr. Randolph
also attracts them. They can get no small
change out of Mr. James Randolph, so they need
not try it on, but once for all we cannot decline the
people who are willing to pay us good money, that
is a foregone conclusion. Now you have got to
accept the agreeables with the disagreeables, or this
whole great scheme of yours will tumble about our
heads like a pack of cards."

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="s08">THE UGLY DRESS</span></h2>

<p>On that very day I searched through mother's
wardrobe and found a piece of brown barége. It
was a harsh and by no means pretty material. I
held it up to the light, and asked her what she was
going to do with it.</p>

<p>"Nothing," she answered, "I bought it ten years
ago at a sale of remnants, and why it has stuck to
me all these years is more than I can tell."</p>

<p>"May I have it?" was my next query.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied mother, "but you surely are
not going to have a dress made of that ugly thing?"</p>

<p>"May I have it?" I asked again.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, yes."</p>

<p>I did not say any more with regard to the barége.
I turned the conversation to indifferent matters, but
when I left the room I took it with me. I made it
into a parcel and took it out. I went to a little
dressmaker in a street near by. I asked her if she
would make the ugly brown barége into an evening
dress. She measured the material, and said it was
somewhat scanty.</p>

<p>"That does not matter," I said, "I <i>want</i> an ugly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
dress&mdash;can you manage to make a really ugly dress
for me out of it?"</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Wickham," she replied, fixing her
pale brown eyes on my face, "I never do go in for
making ugly dresses, it would be against my profession.
You don't mean it, do you, Miss Wickham?"</p>

<p>"Put your best work into it," I said, suddenly changing
my tone. "Make it according to your own ideas
of the fashion. Picture a young girl going to a
play, or a ball, in that dress, and make it according
to your own ideas."</p>

<p>"May I trim it with golden yellow chiffon and
turquoise blue silk bows?" she asked eagerly, her
eyes shining.</p>

<p>"You may," I replied, suppressing an internal
shudder. I gave her a few further directions; she
named a day when I should come to be fitted, and
I went home.</p>

<p>In less than a week's time the brown barége
arrived back, ready for me to wear. It was made
according to Annie Starr's ideas of a fashionable
evening gown. It was the sort of garment which
would have sent the Duchess or Lady Thesiger into
fits on the spot. In the first place, the bodice was
full of wrinkles, it was too wide in the waist, and
too narrow across the chest, but this was a small
matter to complain of. It was the irritating air of
vulgarity all over the dress which was so hard to
bear. But, notwithstanding all these defects, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
pleased me. It would, I hoped, answer my purpose,
and succeed in making me appear very unattractive
in the eyes of Mr. Randolph.</p>

<p>That evening I put on the brown barége for
dinner. The yellow chiffon and the turquoise blue
bows were much in evidence, and I did really feel
that I was a martyr when I went downstairs in that
dress with its <i>outré</i> trimmings.</p>

<p>When I entered the drawing-room, mother glanced
up at me as if she did not know me; she then started,
the colour came into her face, and she motioned me
imperatively to her side.</p>

<p>"Go upstairs at once and take that off," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh no, mother," I answered, "there is no time
now, besides I&mdash;I chose it, I admire it."</p>

<p>"Take it off immediately, Westenra."</p>

<p>"But it is your dear barége that you have kept
for ten years," I said, trying to be playful; "I must
wear it, at least to-night."</p>

<p>I knew that I had never looked worse, and I
quite gloried in the fact. I saw Mr. Randolph from
his seat near mother glance at me several times in
a puzzled way, and Mr. Fanning, after one or two
astonished glances, during which he took in the <i>tout
ensemble</i> of the ugly robe, began to enter into a playful
bear-like flirtation with Miss Armstrong. Dear
brown barége, what service it was doing me! I
secretly determined that it should be my dinner
dress every evening until it wore itself to rags.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
When the turquoise blue bows became too shabby,
I might substitute them for magenta ones. I felt
that I had suddenly found an opening out of my
difficulty. If I ceased to appear attractive, Mr.
Randolph and Mr. Fanning would cease to worry
me, the rest of the boarders would accept me for
what I was, and my Gordian knot would be cut.
Little did I guess! It was by no means so easy to
carry out my fixed determination as I had hoped.
In the first place, poor darling mother nearly fretted
herself into an illness on account of my evening
dress. She absolutely cried when she saw me in it,
and said that if I was determined to deteriorate in
that way, she would give up the boarding-house and
go to the cottage in the country without a moment's
hesitation. After wearing the dress for three or four
days I was forced, very much against my will, to
put on one of my pretty black dresses, and the barége
made by Annie Starr resumed its place in my wardrobe.
I determined to wear it now and then, however&mdash;it
had already done me good service. I
began to hope that neither Mr. Randolph nor Mr.
Fanning thought me worth looking at when I
appeared in it.</p>

<p>On this evening, as I was dressing for dinner, I
heard a wonderful bumping going on in the stairs.
It was the noise made by very heavy trunks, trunks
so large that they seemed scarcely able to be brought
upstairs. They were arriving at the attics, too&mdash;they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
were entering the attic next to mine. Now
that special attic had up to the present remained
untenanted. It was the most disagreeable room in
the house. Most of the attics were quite excellent,
but this room had a decidedly sloping roof, and
rather small windows, and the paper on the walls
was ugly, and the accommodation scanty, and what
those huge boxes were going to do there was more
than I could tell. The boxes, however, entered that
special attic, and then a bodily presence followed
them briskly, a loud hearty voice was heard to
speak. It said in cheerful tones&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thank you, that will do nicely. A large can of
hot water, please, and a couple more candles. Thanks.
What hour did you say the company dined?"</p>

<p>The reply was made in a low tone which I could
not catch, and the attic door was shut.</p>

<p>I was down in the drawing-room in my black
dress&mdash;(how comfortable I felt in it, how hateful
that brown barége was, after all)&mdash;when the door
was opened, and a large, stoutly-made woman, most
richly dressed, came in. She had a quantity of
grizzly grey hair, which was turned back from her
expansive forehead; a cap of almost every colour in
the rainbow bedizened her head, she wore diamond
pendants in her ears, and had a flashing diamond
brooch fastening the front of her dress. Her complexion
was high, she had a broad mouth and a constant
smile. She walked straight up to Jane Mullins.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," she said, "here I am. I have not unpacked
my big trunk, as your servant said there
was very little time before dinner. Please can you
tell me when Albert will be in?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Fanning generally comes home about now," I
heard Jane say. "Mrs. Fanning, may I introduce
you to my dear young friend, Miss Wickham&mdash;Mrs.
Wickham has not yet appeared."</p>

<p>To my horror I saw Miss Mullins advancing across
the drawing-room, accompanied by the stout woman;
they approached to my side.</p>

<p>"May I introduce Mrs. Fanning," said Miss
Mullins&mdash;"Mr. Fanning's mother."</p>

<p>"The mother of dear, godly Albert," said the stout
lady. "I am proud to say I am the mother of one
of the best of sons. I am right pleased to meet
you, Miss Wickham. I may as well say at once
that Albert Fanning, my dear and only son, has
mentioned your name to me, and with an approval
which would make your young cheeks blush. Yes,
I am the last person to encourage vanity in the
young, but I must repeat that if you knew all that
Albert has said, you would feel that flutter of the
heart which only joy brings forth. Now, shall we
both sit in a cosy corner and enjoy ourselves, and
talk about Albert until dinner is ready?"</p>

<p>This treat was certainly not likely to cause my
young cheeks to blush. On the contrary, I felt myself
turning pale, and I looked round with a desperate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
intention of flying to Jane for protection, when the
stout lady took one of my hands.</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, "quite up to date, a slim young
hand, and a slim young figure, and a slim young face,
too, for that matter. All that Albert says is true,
you are a <i>very</i> nice-looking girl. I should not say
that you had much durance in you, that remains to
be proved. But come, here's a cosy corner, I have
a great deal to say."</p>

<p>That hand of Mrs. Fanning's had a wonderfully
clinging effect; it seemed to encircle my fingers
something like an octopus, and she pulled me
gently towards the corner she had in view, and
presently had pinned me there, seating herself well
in front of me, so that there was no possible escape.</p>

<p>The rest of the boarders now entered the drawing-room.
Mother amongst others made her appearance;
she went to her accustomed corner, glanced at me,
saw that I was in one of my black dresses, nodded
approval, concluding in her dear mind that I had
probably met some old friend in the extraordinary
person who was shutting me into the corner, and
took no further notice.</p>

<p>Captain and Mrs. Furlong were well pleased to
see that I was only talking to a woman, it did not
matter at all to them who that woman was. And
as to me I sat perfectly silent while Mrs. Fanning
discoursed on Albert. She never for a single
moment, I will say for her, turned the conversation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
into another channel. Albert was her theme, and
she stuck to him with the pertinacity which would
have done any leader of a debate credit. The
debate was Albert. She intended before dinner
was announced to give me a true insight into that
remarkable man's most remarkable character.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "what Albert thinks is always to
the point. Since a child he never gave me what
you would call a real heartache. Determined, self-willed
he is; you look, the next time you see him,
at his chin, you observe the cleft in the middle;
there never was a chin like that yet without a mind
according&mdash;a mind, so to speak, set on the duty
ahead of it&mdash;a mind that is determined to conquer.
That is Albert, that is my only, godly son. You
observe, when you have an opportunity, Albert's
eyes. Did you ever see anything more open than
the way they look at you? He don't mind whether
it hurts your feelings or not; if he wants to look at
you, look he will."</p>

<p>When she said this I nodded my head emphatically,
for I had found this most disagreeable trait in
Albert's eyes from the first moment I had been
unfortunate enough to make his acquaintance. But
Mrs. Fanning took my nod in high good humour.</p>

<p>"Ah, you have observed it," she said, "and no
wonder, no wonder. Now, when you get an opportunity,
do pull him to pieces, feature by feature;
notice his brow, how lofty it is; there's talent there,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
and t'aint what you would call a fly-away talent,
such as those art talents that make me quite sick.
He has no talent, thank Heaven, for painting or for
poetry, or for any fal-lal of that kind, his talent lies
in a sound business direction. Oh, he has made
me roar, the way he talks of young authors and
young artists, how they come to him with their
wares, and how he beats them down. It's in Albert's
brow where his talent for business lies. You mark
his nose too, it's somewhat long and a little pointed,
but it's the nose of a man who will make his mark;
yes, he'll make his mark some day, and I have told
him so over and over."</p>

<p>Having gone through all Albert's features, she
next proceeded to describe Albert's character, and
then went on to Albert's future. From this it was
an easy step to Albert's wife, and Albert's wife took
up a great deal of the good woman's attention.</p>

<p>"It is because I am thinking he'll soon be falling
into the snares of matrimony that I have come to
stay at 17 Graham Square," continued Mrs. Fanning.
"And it's because I want my dear and godly son to
get a wife who will be on the pattern of Solomon's
virtuous woman that I have given up my home and
broken up my establishment and come here. Now,
Miss Wickham, my dear young lady, did you or did
you not hear the noise of my boxes being brought
upstairs?"</p>

<p>"I certainly did," I replied.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you happen to occupy the bedroom next
to mine?"</p>

<p>"I do," I said.</p>

<p>"That is very nice indeed, for often of an evening
we will keep each other company and discourse on
Albert, to the joy of both our hearts. The boxes
are receptacles for my household gods, dear, those
dear mementoes of the past, that I could not quite
part with. Don't suppose for a moment that they
are full of dresses, for although my taste is light
and festive, Albert likes gay colours, he says they
remind him of the sales of remnants in the autumn.
Dear fellow, it was the most poetical thing he ever
uttered, but he has said it once or twice. I can
show you my household treasures when you feel
disposed to have an evening's real recreation. The
burden of this house, and with so delicate a mother
as your good Ma, must be heavy upon a young lass
like you, but Albert tells me&mdash;but there! I won't
say any more just now, for you'll blush, and I don't
want you to blush, and I don't want to encourage
those hopes that may never be realised. I may as
well whisper, though, that Albert is looking out for a
wife who will be a pattern of Solomon's virtuous
woman, and when he finds her, why she'll be lucky,
that's all I can say."</p>

<p>Just then the pretty silver gong sounded, and
people began to stand up preparatory to going down
to dinner. It was difficult even then to move Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Fanning, and for a wild moment I had a fear that I
might be imprisoned behind her in the drawing-room
all during dinner, while she still discoursed upon
Albert and his attractions. Miss Mullins, however,
came to the rescue.</p>

<p>"Come, Miss Wickham," she cried, "we must lead
the way," and accordingly Jane, my mother, and I
went down first, and the different boarders followed us.</p>

<p>To my infinite distress Mrs. Fanning, being a
complete stranger, had her seat next mine. I had one
comfort, however, she was better than Albert; and
Albert, who arrived presently himself, found that he
was seated next Miss Armstrong. He nodded across
at his mother.</p>

<p>"How do, old lady," he said, "glad to find you
cosily established; everything all right, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Albert, my son," replied the good woman,
"everything is all right, and I have been having a
long conversation about you with my interesting
young friend here, Miss Westenra Wickham. By-the-by,
dear, would you kindly tell me how you got
that outlandish name, I never heard it before, and I
do not believe it belongs to the Christian religion."</p>

<p>"I did not know there was anything heathenish
about it," I could not help answering; "it happens
to be my name, and I was fully baptized by it."</p>

<p>"I will see presently whether I can take to it,"
responded the old lady. "Soup? Yes, please. I
will trouble you, my good girl, for (turning to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
maid) a table-spoon; I never take soup with a dessert
spoon. Thanks; that's better."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fanning now gave me a few moments peace,
and I found, to my great satisfaction, that she had
an excellent appetite, and was also extremely critical
with regard to her food. I introduced her to her
next door neighbour, who happened to be a fat little
woman, something like herself in build. They were
both gourmands, and criticised adversely the meal
to their mutual pleasure. Thus I had time to look
around me, and to consider this new aspect of affairs.
Things were scarcely likely to be more comfortable
if Albert had now got his mother to plead his cause
with me. He glanced at me several times during
the meal, and once even favoured me with a broad
wink&mdash;he was really intolerable.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Miss Armstrong was all blushes and
smirks. I heard her suggest to Mr. Fanning that
she should go the next day to see him, and bring
some of her drawings with her, and I heard him tell
her in what he was pleased to call his brutal manner
that he would not be at home, and if he were and
she came would certainly not see her. This seemed
to be considered a tremendous joke by Miss
Armstrong, and her mother also joined in it, and
gave Mr. Fanning a dig in the ribs, and told him
that he was the soul of wit, and had the true spirit
of heart.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Randolph, my mother, Captain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
and Mrs. Furlong, and the more refined portion of
the establishment enjoyed themselves at the other
end of the table. I saw Mr. Randolph glance down
in my direction once or twice, and I am sure, although
he was not able to judge of the difference, the fact
of seeing me once more in my properly made black
evening dress relieved his mind, for he looked quite
contented, and turned in a cheerful manner to my
mother, and when dinner was over, and we returned
to the drawing-room, I was lucky enough to be able
to escape Mrs. Fanning and to go up to the other
end of the room, where I seated myself close to
mother, took hold of her hand, leant against her
chair, and indulged in the luxury of talking to Mr.
Randolph. He was in a very good humour, and
suggested that we should make a party on the
following evening to another play, which was then
very much in vogue.</p>

<p>"But not in the chocolate-coloured brougham with
the pair of horses," I said.</p>

<p>"We will have a cab from the nearest stand, if
you prefer it," was his instant response.</p>

<p>"I should much," I answered.</p>

<p>"And we will not dine at the Cecil," he continued;
"we can have a sort of high tea here before we start."</p>

<p>"That I should also like infinitely better," I
answered.</p>

<p>"It shall be as you please," was his response.
Then he began to tell us something of the play
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
which we were about to see, and I forgot all about
my discomforts, and enjoyed myself well.</p>

<p>I was putting things in order in the drawing-room
that night, for this was always one of my
special duties, when Mr. Fanning, who had left the
room a long time ago, came back. He came up to
me holding his lighted candle in his hand. I started
when I saw him.</p>

<p>"Good night," I said coldly.</p>

<p>"Pray don't go for a moment," he said. "I have
come back here on the express chance of seeing you."</p>

<p>"I cannot wait now, Mr. Fanning," I replied.</p>

<p>"But I really must have an interview with you,
it is of the highest importance,&mdash;when can I see you
alone? When can you give me an hour of your
time quite undisturbed?"</p>

<p>"Never," I answered brusquely.</p>

<p>"Now you will forgive me for saying that that is
pure nonsense. If you will not promise me an hour
of your own free will I shall take the present opportunity
of speaking to you."</p>

<p>"But I shall not stay," I answered with spirit,
"and you cannot keep me here against my will. Mr.
Fanning, I also will take the present opportunity of
telling you that you and I have nothing in common,
that I dislike your singling me out for special conversations
of any kind, and that I hope in the future
you will clearly understand that I do not wish you
to do so."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, that is all very fine," he said, "but come
now; what have I done to make myself obnoxious?
There is the old lady upstairs, she has taken no end
of a fancy to you, she says you are the most charming
and the prettiest girl she has ever seen, and
what have you to say against my mother? Let me
tell you that she has come to this house on purpose
to make your acquaintance."</p>

<p>"I have nothing whatever to say against your
mother, Mr. Fanning, but I object to the subject of
conversation which she chooses to occupy her time
with while talking to me. I am not in the least
interested in you, and I wish you and your mother
clearly to understand this fact as quickly as possible."</p>

<p>I do not think it was in the nature of Mr. Fanning
ever to look crestfallen, or my present speech might
have made him do so. He did not even change
colour, but he looked at me out of those eyes which
his mother had so vividly described, and after a
moment said softly&mdash;</p>

<p>"There will come a day when you will regret
this. An honest heart is offered to you and you
trample it in the dust, but there will come a day
when you will be sorry. How do you think this
establishment is working?"</p>

<p>I was so astonished and relieved at his change of
conversation that I said&mdash;</p>

<p>"It seems to be going very well, don't you think
so?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span></p>

<p>"It is going well for my purpose," he replied, and
then he added, "it is working itself out in a way
that will only spell one word&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ruin</span>. Now you
ponder on that. Take it as your night-cap, and see
what sort of sleep you'll have, and when next I ask
for a few moments' conversation perhaps you'll not
say no. I will not keep you any longer for the
present."</p>

<p>He left the room, I heard his footsteps dying
down the corridor, and the next instant he had
slammed his bedroom door.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="s08">ANXIETY</span></h2>

<p>After he had left me, and I was quite certain that
I should not see him again that night, I went
straight to Jane Mullins' room. Jane was generally
up the last in the house, and I had not the slightest
doubt I should still find her in her dinner dress, and
ready for conversation. I had bidden mother good
night long ago, and hoped she was sound asleep,
but I did not mind disturbing Jane. I opened the
door now and went in. As I expected, Jane was up;
she was seated by the fire, she was looking into its
depths, and did not turn round at once when I
entered. The first thing she did when she became
aware of the fact that there was some one else in
the room besides herself, was to sigh somewhat
deeply. Then she said in a low voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"What if it all turns out a mistake?" and then she
jumped to her feet and confronted me. "Yes, dear,
yes," she said. "Oh, my dear Westenra, why aren't
you in bed? It is very bad indeed for young people to
be up so late. You will get quite worn and wrinkled.
Let me tell you, my love, that we can never get
youth back again, and we ought to prize it while we
have it. How old are you, Westenra, my love?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall be twenty-two my next birthday," was
my answer.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, yes, quite young, in the beautiful prime
of youth. Nevertheless, the bloom can be rubbed off,
and then&mdash;well, it never comes back, dear. But go
to bed, Westenra, don't stay up bothering your head.
I see by that frown between your brows that you
are going to say something which I would rather not
listen to. Don't tell me to-night, Westenra, love."</p>

<p>"I must tell you," I answered. "I have come to
see you for the purpose. You are old enough, Jane,
to bear the little disagreeable things I tell you now
and then. You are our mainstay, our prop, in this
establishment. I cannot go on without confiding
in you, and you must listen to me."</p>

<p>"Well, child, sit down, here is a comfortable
chair." Jane got up and offered me her own chair.
I did not take it.</p>

<p>"What nonsense," I said, "sit down again. Here,
this little hassock at your feet will suit me far
better."</p>

<p>I seated myself as I spoke, and laid my hand
across Jane's knee.</p>

<p>"Now, that is cosy," I said. She touched my
arm as though she loved to touch it, and then she
laid her firm, weather-beaten hand on my shoulder,
and then, as if impelled by an unwonted impulse,
she bent forward and kissed me on my cheek.</p>

<p>"You are a very nice girl. Since I knew you life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
has been far pleasanter to me," said Jane Mullins.
"I thank you for giving me a bit of love. Whatever
happens I want you to remember that."</p>

<p>"I do," I answered; "you have very little idea
how much I care for you, Jane, and how immensely
I respect you. There are, I think, very few women
who would have acted as you have done. I am
fully convinced there is a mystery in all your actions
which has not yet been explained to me, but I
have not come here to-night to talk about that. I
have come here to ask you one or two questions,
and to tell you one or two things, and my first question
is this&mdash;Why were you sighing when I came
in, and why did you murmur to yourself, 'What if
it all turns out a mistake?' Will you explain
those words, Jane."</p>

<p>"No," replied Jane stoutly, "for you were eavesdropping
when you heard them, and there is no
reason why I should explain what you had no right
to listen to."</p>

<p>"Thank you; you have answered me very sensibly,
and I won't say another word on the subject
of your sigh and your remarkable speech. But
now to turn to the matter which has brought me to
your room so late in the evening."</p>

<p>"Well, dear, it is past midnight, and you know
how early I am up. It is a little unreasonable of
you; what has brought you, darling?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Fanning has brought me."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh dear, oh dear, that tiresome man again,"
said Miss Mullins.</p>

<p>"You don't like him yourself, do you, Jane?"</p>

<p>"It is a great pity he is not different," said Jane,
"for he is extremely well off."</p>

<p>"O Jane! pray don't talk nonsense. Do you
suppose that a person with the name of Fanning
could have any interest whatever for me? Now,
please, get that silly idea out of your head once for
all."</p>

<p>"Oh, as far as any use that there is in it, I have
long ago got it out of my head," replied Jane; "but
the thing to be considered is this, that he has not
got it out of his head&mdash;nor has his mother&mdash;and
that between them they can make things intensely
disagreeable. Now, if Mr. Randolph was going to
stay here, I should not have an anxious moment."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I cried; "is Mr. Randolph
going away?" A deep depression seemed
suddenly to come over me; I could not quite
account for it.</p>

<p>"He is, dear; and it is because he must be absent
for two or three months that I am really anxious.
He will come back again; but sudden and important
news obliges him to go to Australia. He is
going in a fortnight, and it is that that frets him.
You will be left to the tender mercies of Mr.
Fanning and Mrs. Fanning, and you have got so
much spirit you are sure to offend them both mortally,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
and then they will leave, and&mdash;oh dear, I do
think that things are dark. My dear Westenra, I
often wonder if we shall pull through after all."</p>

<p>"That is what I want to speak to you about," I
answered. "Mr. Fanning came into the drawing-room
just now, and was very rude and very unlike
a gentleman. I was alone there, and he said he
had something to say to me in private, and, of
course, I refused to listen. He wanted to insist on
my granting him an interview, and said that he
could compel me to listen if he chose. Think of
any gentleman speaking like that!"</p>

<p>"They don't mind what they say, nor what they
do, when they're in love," muttered Jane.</p>

<p>"I won't allow you to say that," I answered,
springing to my feet; "the man is intolerable.
Jane, he must go; there is no help for it."</p>

<p>"He must stay, dear, and I cannot disclose all
my reasons now."</p>

<p>I stood clasping and unclasping my hands, and
staring at Jane.</p>

<p>"You knew beforehand, did you not, Westenra,
that there would be disagreeables connected with
this scheme?"</p>

<p>"Of course I knew it; but I never did think
that the disagreeables would resolve themselves into
Mr. Fanning."</p>

<p>"We never know beforehand where the shoe is
going to pinch," remarked Jane in a sententious voice.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I have something else to say," I continued.
"Mr. Fanning was not only very unpleasant to me,
but he told me something which I can scarcely
believe. He said that our boarding-house, which
seemed to be going so well, was not going well
at all. He said there was only one word to spell
how it was going, and that word was RUIN. O
Jane! it can't be true?"</p>

<p>"Let us hope not," said Jane, but she turned very
white. "I will tell you one thing, Westenra," she
continued. "If you don't want to have utter ruin
you must go on behaving as nicely as ever you can,
bearing with every one, being gentle and considerate,
and trying to make every one happy. And in
especial, you must bear with Mr. Fanning and with
Mrs. Fanning; you must be particularly civil to
them both, for if they go others will go; and whatever
happens, Westenra, remember your mother is
not to be worried. I know what I am saying, your
mother is not to be worried. Your mother must
never guess that things are not as right as they
should be. When Mr. Randolph comes back everything
will be right, but during his absence we will
have to go through rather a tight place; and Albert
Fanning is the sort of person who might take advantage
of us, and what you must do, my dear girl,
is to be guileful."</p>

<p>"Guileful!" I cried; "never."</p>

<p>"But you must, my love, you must be guileful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
and wary; you need not give him a single straw to
go upon, but at the same time you must be civil.
There now, that is all I can tell you for the present.
Go to bed, child, for I have to do the daily accounts,
and must be up at six in the morning. It's that
new cook, she frets me more than I can say, she
don't do things proper; and I noticed that Mrs.
Fanning sniffed at her soup instead of eating it this
evening, and the turbot was not as fresh as it ought
to be. Go to bed, Westenra, go to bed."</p>

<p>I left the room. There was no use in staying any
longer with Jane. She certainly had not reassured
me. She seemed puzzled and anxious about the
establishment; and why were not things going well?
And what had Mr. Fanning to do with it; and why,
why was Mr. Randolph going away?</p>

<p>The next morning after breakfast I went into the
drawing-room for my usual task of dusting and
arranging the furniture and refilling the vases with
fresh flowers, when Mr. Randolph suddenly came in.</p>

<p>"It will be best for you and Mrs. Wickham to
meet me at the Criterion to-night," he said. "As
you won't give me the opportunity of offering you
dinner at the Cecil, that seems the next best thing
to do. I have got a box in a good part of the
house, so we need not be there more than a few
minutes before it commences. I shall meet you at
the entrance and conduct you to your seats."</p>

<p>His manner showed some excitement, quite out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
of keeping with his ordinary demeanour, and I
noticed that he scarcely glanced at me. His face
was somewhat worn, too, in expression, and although
he generally had himself in complete control, he
now looked nearly as anxious and worried as Jane
herself. He scarcely waited for my compliance with
the arrangement he had proposed, but glancing at
the door, spoke abruptly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Something unexpected and very grievous has
occurred, and I am obliged to leave England by the
<i>Smyrna</i>, which sails on Saturday week."</p>

<p>"Miss Mullins told me last night that you were
going away," I replied. I also now avoided looking
at him. I was playing with some large sprays of
mimosa which had been sent in from the market.
To my dying day I shall never forget how that
mimosa seemed to slip about, and would not get
into the best position in the vase in which I was
placing it.</p>

<p>"Effective," he said, as he watched my movements,
"but it withers quickly; it wants its native
air."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," I answered.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen it growing?"</p>

<p>"No; I have never been to the South."</p>

<p>"You have a good deal to see. I hope some
day&mdash;&mdash;" He broke off.</p>

<p>"Where are you going when you do go away?" I
asked.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<p>"To Sydney first, perhaps to Melbourne."</p>

<p>"It will be nice for you to leave England during
our unpleasant winter weather."</p>

<p>"There is nothing nice about my visit," he said;
"I dislike going more than I have any words to
express. In particular, I am sorry to leave your
mother; but before I go I want"&mdash;he dropped his
voice and came a step nearer.</p>

<p>"What?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I am anxious that your mother should see a
doctor&mdash;a specialist, I mean. I am not satisfied
with her condition."</p>

<p>"But mother is really quite well," I said impulsively.
"You have not known her long, Mr. Randolph;
she never was really strong. She is quite
as well as she ever was."</p>

<p>"A specialist could assure us on that point, could
he not?" was his reply. "I want Dr. Reade to give
me a diagnosis of her case."</p>

<p>"Dr. Reade," I cried.</p>

<p>"Yes; I should like her to see him between now
and the day when I must leave England. I cannot
possibly be back under from four to five months,
and if my mind can be relieved of a very pressing
anxiety, you would not deny me the satisfaction,
would you?"</p>

<p>"But why should your mind be anxious?" I
asked boldly. I looked full into his face as I spoke,
and then I met a look which caused me to turn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
faint, and yet to feel happy, as I had never felt
happy before. I lowered my eyes and looked out
of the window. He gave a quick sigh, and then
said suddenly&mdash;</p>

<p>"How like your father you are."</p>

<p>"My father? But you never knew him."</p>

<p>"I never knew him, but I have often looked at
his picture. Can you tell me how he won his V.C.?"</p>

<p>"Saving a comrade, bringing one of his brother
officers out of the thick of the fight; he received
his own fatal wound in doing so. He did not survive
the action two months."</p>

<p>"A fine fellow! A splendid action," said Mr.
Randolph, enthusiasm in his voice. "You will
think over what I have said, and I will not keep
you now. We shall meet at the Criterion this
evening. Good-bye for the present."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="s08">DR. READE</span></h2>

<p>I cannot recall anything about the play. I only
know that we had excellent seats and a good view
of the house, and that mother seemed to enjoy
everything. As to Mr. Randolph, I doubt if he did
enjoy that play. He was too much a man of the
world to show any of his emotions, but I saw by a
certain pallor round his mouth, and a rather dragged
look about his eyes, that he was suffering, and I
could not imagine why. I had always in my own
mind made up a sort of story about Jim Randolph.
He was one of the fortunate people of the earth;
the good things of the world had fallen abundantly
to his share. He was nice to look at and pleasant
to talk to, and of course he had plenty of money.
He could do what he pleased with his life. I had
never associated him with sorrow or trial of any
sort, and to see that look now in his eyes and round
the corners of his somewhat sensitive and yet beautifully-cut
mouth, gave me a new sensation with
regard to him. The interest I felt in him immediately
became accelerated tenfold. I found myself
thinking of him instead of the play. I found myself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
anxious to watch his face. I even found, when once
our eyes met (his grave and dark, mine, I daresay,
bold enough and determined enough), that my heart
beat fast, and the colour flew into my face; then,
strange to say, the colour came into his face, dying
his swarthy cheek just for a moment, but leaving it
the next paler than ever. He came a little nearer
to me, however, and bending forward so that mother
should not hear, said in a semi-whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have thought about what I said this
morning?"</p>

<p>"I have thought it over a good deal," I replied.</p>

<p>"You think it can be managed?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Anderson, mother's family physician, would
do what you require, Mr. Randolph."</p>

<p>"That is a good idea," he said. "Anderson can
arrange a consultation. I will see him to-morrow,
and suggest it."</p>

<p>I did not say any more, for just then mother
turned and said something to Mr. Randolph, and
Mr. Randolph bent forward and talked to mother in
that worshipping son-like way with which he generally
addressed her. If mother had ever been
blessed with a son, he could not have been more
attentive nor sweeter than Jim Randolph was, and
I found myself liking him more than ever, just
because he was so good to mother, and my heart
ached at the prospect of his enforced and long
absence. So much did this thought worry me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
that I could not help saying to him as we were
leaving the theatre&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am very sorry that you are going."</p>

<p>"Is that true?" he said. His face lit up, his
eyes sparkled; all the tired expression left his eyes
and mouth.</p>

<p>"Are you saying what you mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am most truly sorry. You have become indispensable
to mother; she will miss you sorely."</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;will you miss me?"</p>

<p>I tried to say "For mother's sake I will," but I
did not utter the words. Mr. Randolph gave me a
quick glance.</p>

<p>"I have not told your mother yet that I am
going," he said.</p>

<p>"I wondered if you had," I replied. "I thought
of telling her myself to-day."</p>

<p>"Do not say anything until nearer the time," was
his somewhat guarded response. "Ah! here comes
the carriage."</p>

<p>"So you did order the carriage after all," I said,
seeing that the same neat brougham which he had
used on the last occasion stopped the way.</p>

<p>"You never forbade me to see you both home in
the carriage," he said with a laugh. "Now then,
Mrs. Wickham."</p>

<p>Mother had been standing a little back out of the
crowd. He went to her, gave her his arm, and she
stepped into the carriage, just as if it belonged to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
her. Mother had always that way with Mr. Randolph's
possessions, and sometimes her manner towards him
almost annoyed me. What could it mean. Did she
know something about him which I had never heard
of nor guessed?</p>

<p>The next day about noon Mr. Randolph entered
Jane's sitting-room, where I often spent the mornings.</p>

<p>"I have just come from Anderson's," he said.
"He will make an appointment with Dr. Reade to
see your mother to-morrow."</p>

<p>"But on what plea?" I asked. "Mother is somewhat
nervous. I am sure it would not be at all
good for her to think that her indisposition was so
great that two doctors must see her."</p>

<p>"Anderson will arrange that," replied Mr. Randolph.
"He has told your mother once or twice
lately that he thinks her very weak, and would like
her to try a new system of diet. Now Reade is a
great specialist for diseases of the digestion. Both
doctors will guard against any possible shock to
your mother."</p>

<p>"Well," I said somewhat petulantly, "I cannot
imagine why you are nervous about her. She is
quite as well as she ever was."</p>

<p>He looked at me as if he meant to say something
more, and I felt certain that he strangled a sigh
which never came to the surface. The next moment
he left the room, I looked round me in a state of
bewilderment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>In Jane's room was a bookcase, and the bookcase
contained a heterogeneous mass of books of all sorts.
Amongst others was a medical directory. I took it
up now, and scarcely knowing why I did so, turned
to the name of Reade. Dr. Reade's name was entered
in the following way:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Reade, Henry, M.D., F.R.C.P., consulting physician
to the Brompton Hospital for Consumption, London,
and to the Royal Hospital for Diseases of the Chest,
Ventnor."</p>

<p>I read these qualifications over slowly, and put the
book back in its place. There was nothing whatever
said of Dr. Reade's qualifications for treating that
vast field of indigestion to which so many sufferers
were victims. I resolved to say something to Jane.</p>

<p>"What is it?" said Jane, as she came into the
room. "What is fretting you now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," I answered. "Dr. Reade must be
a very clever physician."</p>

<p>"First-class, of course. I am so pleased your
mother is going to see him."</p>

<p>"But I thought mother was suffering very much
from weakness and want of appetite."</p>

<p>"So she is, poor dear, and I am inventing quite a
new sort of soup, which is partly digested beforehand,
that I think she will fancy."</p>

<p>"But I have been looking up Dr. Reade's name.
He seems to be a great doctor for consumption and
other diseases of the chest. There is no allusion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
to his extraordinary powers of treating people for
indigestion."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, consumptives suffer more than
most folks from indigestion. Now, don't you
worry your head; never meet troubles half-way.
I am extremely pleased that your mother is to see
Dr. Reade."</p>

<p>On the following morning mother herself told me
that Dr. Reade was coming.</p>

<p>"It is most unnecessary," she said, "and I told
Dr. Anderson so. I was only telling him yesterday
that I thought his own visits need not be quite so
frequent. He is such a dear, kind man, that I do
not like to hurt his feelings; but really, Westenra,
he charges me so little that it quite goes to my
heart. And now we have not our old income, this
very expensive consulting physician is not required.
I told Dr. Anderson so, but he has made up his
mind. He says there is no use in working in the
dark, and that he believes I should be much stronger
if I ate more."</p>

<p>Dr. Reade called in the course of the morning,
and Dr. Anderson came with him. They stayed in
mother's room for some little time, and then they
both went out, and Jane Mullins had an interview
with them first, and then she sent for me.</p>

<p>"Dr. Anderson wants to speak to you, Westenra,"
she said. She rushed past me as she spoke, and I
could not catch sight of her face, so I went into her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
little sitting-room, where both the doctors were
waiting for me, and closed the door behind me. I
was not at all anxious. I quite believed that
mother's ailment was simply want of appetite and
weakness, and I had never heard of any one dying
just from those causes.</p>

<p>"Let me introduce you to Dr. Reade," said Dr.
Anderson.</p>

<p>I looked then towards the great consulting physician.
He was standing with his back to the light&mdash;he
was a little man, younger looking than Dr.
Anderson. His hair was only beginning to turn
grey, and was falling away a trifle from his temples,
and he was very upright, and very thin, and had
keen eyes, the keenest eyes I had ever looked at,
small, grey and bright, and those eyes seemed to
look through you, as though they were forcing a
gimlet into the very secrets of your soul. His face
was so peculiar, so intellectual, so sharp and keen,
and his glance so vivid, that I became absorbed in
looking at it, and forgot for the moment Dr.
Anderson. Then I glanced round and found that
he had vanished, and I was alone with Dr. Reade.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down, Miss Wickham?" he said
kindly.</p>

<p>I seated myself, and then seeing that his eyes
were still on me, my heart began to beat a little
more quickly, and I began to feel uncomfortable
and anxious, and then I knew that I must brace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
myself up to listen to something which would be
hard to bear.</p>

<p>"I was called in to-day," said Dr. Reade, "to see
your mother. I have examined her carefully&mdash;Dr.
Anderson thinks that it may be best for you
Miss Wickham&mdash;you seem to be a very brave sort of
girl&mdash;to know the truth."</p>

<p>"Yes, I should like to know the truth," I
answered.</p>

<p>I found these words coming out of my lips slowly,
and I found I had difficulty in saying them, and my
eyes seemed not to see quite so clearly as usual; and
Dr. Reade's keen face seemed to vanish as if behind
a mist, but then the mist cleared off, and I remembered
that I was father's daughter and that it behoved
me to act gallantly if occasion should require,
so I got up and went towards the little doctor, and
said in a quiet voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"You need not mind breaking it to me; I see by
your face that you have bad news, but I assure you
I am not going to cry nor be hysterical. Please tell
me the truth quickly."</p>

<p>"I knew you were a brave girl," he said with admiration,
"and I have bad news, your mother's case
is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" I asked.</p>

<p>"A matter of time," he replied gravely; "she may
live for a few months or a year&mdash;a year is the outside
limit."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<p>"A few months or a year," I said. I repeated
the words vaguely; and then I turned my eyes
towards the window and looked past it and out into
the Square. I saw a carriage drawn by a spirited
pair of bays, it passed within sight of the window,
and I noticed a girl seated by herself in the carriage.
She had on a fashionable hat, and her hair was
arranged in a very pretty way, and she had laughing
eyes. I was attracted by her appearance, and I even
said to myself in an uncertain sort of fashion, "I
believe I could copy that hat," but then I turned
away from the window and faced the doctor.</p>

<p>"You are very brave," he repeated; "I did not
think any girl would be quite so brave."</p>

<p>"My father was a brave man," I said then; "he
won his Victoria Cross."</p>

<p>"Ah," replied Dr. Reade, "women often do just
as brave actions. Their battles are silent, but none
the less magnificent for that."</p>

<p>"I always meant to get the Victoria Cross if I
could," was my reply.</p>

<p>"Well," he answered cheerfully, "I know now
how to deal with things; I am very glad that you
are that sort. You know that Jim Randolph is a
friend of mine."</p>

<p>It was on the tip of my tongue to say, Who is
Jim Randolph? why should he be a friend of everybody
worth knowing? but I did not ask the question.
I put it aside and said gravely&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<p>"The person I want to talk about is mother. In
the first place, what is the matter with her?"</p>

<p>"A very acute form of heart disease. The aortic
valve is affected. She may not, and probably will
not, suffer much; but at any moment, Miss Wickham,
at any moment, any shock may"&mdash;he raised his
hand emphatically.</p>

<p>"You mean that any shock may kill her?"</p>

<p>"That is what I mean."</p>

<p>"Then she ought to be kept without anxiety?"</p>

<p>"That is precisely what I intend."</p>

<p>"And if this is done how long will her most precious
life be prolonged?"</p>

<p>"As I have just said, a year is about the limit."</p>

<p>"One year," I answered. "Does she know?"</p>

<p>"No, she has not the slightest idea, nor do I want
her to be told. She is ready&mdash;would to God we
were all as ready&mdash;why distress her unnecessarily?
She would be anxious about you if she thought she
was leaving you. It must be your province to give
her no anxiety, to guard her. That is an excellent
woman, Miss Mullins, she will assist you in every
way. I am truly sorry that Jim Randolph has to
leave England. However, there is not the slightest
doubt that he will hurry home, and when he does
come back, will be time sufficient to let your mother
know the truth."</p>

<p>I did not answer. Dr. Reade looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"I must be off," he said. "I can only spare one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
more moment. I have made certain suggestions to
my old friend Anderson, and he will propose certain
arrangements which may add to your mother's comfort.
I do not want her to go up and down stairs
much, but at the same time she must be entertained
and kept cheerful. Be assured of one thing, that
in no case will she suffer. Now, I have told you all.
If you should be perplexed or in any difficulty come
to me at once. Come to me as your friend, and
remember I am a very special friend of Jim Randolph's.
Now, good-bye."</p>

<p>He left the room.</p>

<p>I sat after he had gone for a moment without
stirring; I was not suffering exactly. We do not
suffer most when the heavy blows fall, it is afterwards
that the terrible agony of pain comes on. Of
course I believed Dr. Reade&mdash;who could doubt him
who looked into his face? I guessed him to be
what he was, one of the strongest, most faithful,
bravest men who ever lived&mdash;a man whose whole
life was given up to the alleviation of the suffering
of others. He was always warding off death, or
doing all that man could do to ward it off, and in many
many cases death was afraid of him, and retired
from his prey, vanquished by that knowledge, that
genius, that sympathy, that love for humanity, which
overflowed the little doctor's personality.</p>

<p>Just then a hand touched me, and I turned and
saw Jim Randolph.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>"You know?" he said.</p>

<p>I nodded. Mr. Randolph looked at me very
gravely.</p>

<p>"My suspicions have been confirmed," he said;
"I always guessed that your mother's state of health
was most precarious. I can scarcely explain to you
the intense pain I feel in leaving her now. A girl
like you ought to have some man at hand to help
her, but I must go, there is no help for it. It is a
terrible trial to me. I know, Miss Wickham, that
you will guard your mother from all sorrows and
anxieties, and so cheer her passage from this world
to the next. Her death may come suddenly or
gradually, there is just a possibility that she may
know when she is dying, and at such a time, to
know also that you are unprovided for, will give her
great and terrible anxiety." Here he looked at me
as if he were anxious to say more, but he restrained
himself. "I cannot remove her anxiety, I must trust
for the very best, and you must wait and&mdash;and <i>trust
me</i>. I will come back as soon as ever I can."</p>

<p>"But why do you go away?" I asked, "you have
been kind&mdash;more than kind&mdash;to her. O Mr. Randolph!
do you think I have made a mistake, a great
mistake, in coming here?"</p>

<p>"No," he said emphatically, "do not let that
thought ever worry you, you have done a singularly
brave thing, you can little guess what I&mdash;but there,
I said I would not speak, not yet." He shut his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
lips, and I noticed that drawn look round his eyes
and mouth.</p>

<p>"I must go and return as fast as I can," he said
abruptly. "I set myself a task, and I must carry
it through to the bitter end. Only unexpected
calamity drives me from England just now."</p>

<p>"You are keeping a secret from me," I said.</p>

<p>"I am," he replied.</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me&mdash;is it fair to keep me in the
dark?"</p>

<p>"It is perfectly fair."</p>

<p>"Does Jane know?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"And she won't tell?"</p>

<p>"No, she won't tell."</p>

<p>"Does mother know?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and no. She knows something but not all,
by no means all."</p>

<p>"It puzzles me more than I can describe," I continued.
"Why do you live in a place like this, why
are you so interested in mother and in me? Then,
too, you are a special friend of the Duchess of
Wilmot's, who is also one of our oldest friends. You
do not belong to the set of people who live in boarding-houses.
I wish, I do wish, you would be open.
It is unfair on me to keep me in the dark."</p>

<p>"I will tell you when I return," he said, and his
face was very white. "Trust me until I return."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="s08">GIVE ME YOUR PROMISE</span></h2>

<p>That afternoon I went out late to do some commissions
for Jane. I was glad to be out and to be
moving, for Dr. Reade's words kept ringing in my
ears, and by degrees they were beginning to hurt.
I did not want them to hurt badly until night, for
nothing would induce me to break down. I had
talked to mother more cheerfully than ever that
afternoon, and made her laugh heartily, and put
her into excellent spirits, and I bought some lovely
flowers for her while I was out, and a little special
dainty for her dinner. Oh, it would never do for
mother to guess that I was unhappy, but I could
not have kept up with that growing pain at my
heart if it were not for the thought of night and
solitude, the long blessed hours when I might give
way, when I might let my grief, the first great grief
of my life, overpower me.</p>

<p>I was returning home, when suddenly, just before
I entered the Square, I came face to face with Mr.
Randolph. He was hurrying as if to meet me.
When he saw me he slackened his steps and walked
by my side.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>

<p>"This is very fortunate," he said. "I want to
talk to you. Where can we go?"</p>

<p>"But it is nearly dinner-time," I answered.</p>

<p>"That does not matter," he replied. "I have
but a very few more days in England. I have
something I must say to you. Ah, here is the
Square garden open; we will go in."</p>

<p>He seemed to take my assent for granted, and I
did not at all mind accompanying him. We went
into the little garden in the middle of the Square.
In the midst of summer, or at most in early spring,
it might possibly have been a pleasant place, but
now few words could explain its dreariness. The
damp leaves of late autumn were lying in sodden
masses on the paths. There was very little light
too; once I slipped and almost fell. My companion
put out his hand and caught mine. He
steadied me and then dropped my hand. After a
moment of silence he spoke.</p>

<p>"You asked me to-day not to go."</p>

<p>"For mother's sake," I replied.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you now that if I could stay I
would; that it is very great pain to me to go away.
I think it is due to you that I should give you some
slight explanation. I am leaving England thus
suddenly because the friend who has helped Jane
Mullins with a certain sum of money, in order to
enable her to start this boarding-house, has suddenly
heard that the capital, which he hoped was absolutely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
secure, is in great danger of being lost. My friend
has commissioned me to see this matter through,
for if his worst surmises are fulfilled Miss Mullins,
and you also, Miss Wickham, and of course your
mother, may find yourselves in an uncomfortable
position. You remember doubtless that Mr. Hardcastle
would not let you the house if there had not
been some capital at the back of your proposal.
Miss Mullins, who had long wished for such an
opportunity, was delighted to find that she could
join forces with you in the matter. Thus 17
Graham Square was started on its present lines.
Now there is a possibility that the capital which
Jane Mullins was to have as her share in this
business may not be forthcoming. It is in jeopardy,
and I am going to Australia in order to
put things straight; I have every hope that I shall
succeed. You may rest assured that I shall remain
away for as short a time as possible. I know what
grief you are in, but I hope to be back in England
soon."</p>

<p>"Is that all you have to say to me?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not quite all. I am most anxious that while I
am away, although you are still kept in the dark,
you should believe in me; I want you to trust me
and also my friend. Believe that his intentions are
honourable, are kind, are just, and that we are acting
as we are doing both for your sake and for your
mother's and for Miss Mullins'. I know that I ask
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
quite a big thing, Miss Wickham; it is this&mdash;I ask
you to trust me in the dark."</p>

<p>"It is a big thing and difficult," I replied.</p>

<p>"Your mother does."</p>

<p>"That is true, but mother would trust any one
who had been as kind to her as you have been."</p>

<p>"Then will you trust me because your mother
does? will you believe that when I come back I shall
be in a position to set all her fears and yours also
absolutely at rest? I am certain of this, I go away
with a hope which I dare not express more fully;
I shall come back trusting that that hope may be
fulfilled in all its magnificence for myself. I cannot
say more at present. I long to, but I dare not.
Will you trust me? will you try to understand?
Why, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>He turned and looked at me abruptly. Quick
sobs were coming from my lips. I suddenly and
unexpectedly lost my self-control.</p>

<p>"I shall be all right in a minute," I said. "I have
gone through much to-day; it is&mdash;it is on account
of mother. Don't&mdash;don't speak for a moment."</p>

<p>He did not, he stood near me. When I had
recovered he said gently&mdash;</p>

<p>"Give me your promise. I wish I could say more,
much, much more, but will you trust me in the dark?"</p>

<p>"I will," I replied. "I am sorry you are going.
Thank you for being kind to mother; come back
when you can."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>

<p>"You may be certain on that point," he replied.
"I leave England with extreme unwillingness. Thank
you for what you have promised."</p>

<p>He held out his hand and I gave him mine. I
felt my heart beat as my hand lay for a moment in
his, his fingers closed firmly over it, then he slowly
dropped it. We went back to the house.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards Mr. Randolph went away.
He went quite quietly, without making the slightest
commotion. He just entered the drawing-room
quickly one morning after breakfast, and shook
hands with mother and shook hands with me, and
said that he would be back again before either of us
had missed him, and then went downstairs, and I
watched behind the curtain as his luggage was put
on the roof of the cab. I watched him get in. Jane
Mullins was standing near. He shook hands with
her. He did not once glance up at our windows,
the cab rolled out of the Square and was lost to
view. Then I turned round. There were tears in
mother's eyes.</p>

<p>"He is the nicest fellow I have ever met," she
said, "I am so very sorry that he has gone."</p>

<p>"Well, Mummy darling," I answered, "you are
more my care than ever now."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not thinking of myself," said mother.
She looked up at me rather uneasily. It seemed to
me as if her eyes wanted to read me through, and
I felt that I did not want her to read me through;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
I did not want any one to read what my feelings
were that day.</p>

<p>Jane Mullins came bustling up.</p>

<p>"It is a lovely morning, and your mother must
have a drive," she said. "I have ordered a carriage.
It will be round in half-an-hour. You and she are
to drive in the Park and be back in time for lunch,
and see here, Mrs. Wickham, I want you to taste
this. I have made it from a receipt in the new
invalid cookery book. I think you will say that
you never tasted such soup before."</p>

<p>"Oh, you quite spoil me, Jane," said mother, but
she took the soup which Jane had prepared so delicately
for her, and I ran off, glad to be by myself
for a few moments.</p>

<p>At dinner that day Mrs. Fanning and Mrs. Armstrong
sat side by side. Mrs. Fanning had taken a
great fancy to Mrs. Armstrong, and they usually
during the meal sat with their heads bent towards
one another, talking eagerly, and often glancing in
the direction of Albert Fanning and Miss Armstrong
and me. Mrs. Fanning had an emphatic way of
bobbing her head whenever she looked at me, and
after giving me a steady glance, her eyes involuntarily
rolled round in the direction of Mr. Fanning.</p>

<p>I was so well aware of these glances that I now
never pretended to see them, but not one of them
really escaped my notice. After dinner that evening
the good lady came up to my side.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, my dear, well," she said, "and how are you
bearing up?"</p>

<p>"Bearing up?" I answered, "I don't quite understand."</p>

<p>Now of course no one in the boarding-house was
supposed to know anything whatever with regard to
mother's health. The consultation of the doctors
had been so contrived that the principal boarders
had been out when it took place, therefore I knew
that Mrs. Fanning was not alluding to the doctors.
She sat down near me.</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, "I thought, and I told my dear
son Albert, that a man of that sort would not stay
very long. You are bearing up, for you are a
plucky sort of girl, but you must be feeling it a
good bit. I am sorry for you, you have been a silly
girl, casting your eyes at places too high for you,
and never seeing those good things which are laid
so to speak at your very feet. You are like all the
rest of the world, but if you think that my Albert
will put up with other people's leavings, you are
finely mistaken."</p>

<p>"Really, Mrs. Fanning," I answered, "I am completely
at a loss to know what you are talking about."</p>

<p>Here I heard Mrs. Armstrong's hearty and coarse
laugh in my ear.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" said Mrs. Armstrong, "so she says
she doesn't know. Well now then, we won't allude
any further to the subject. Of course it ain't likely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
that she would give herself away. Few young
ladies of the Miss Westenra Wickham type do.
Whatever else they don't hold with, they hold on
to their sinful pride, they quite forget that they are
worms of the dust, that their fall will come, and
when it comes it's bitter, that's what I say; that's
what I have said to Marion, when Marion has been
a little put out, poor dear, with the marked and
silly attentions of one who never meant anything
at all. It was only before dinner I said to Marion,
'You wouldn't like to be in Miss Wickham's shoes
to-night, would you, Marion? You wouldn't like
to be wearing the willow, would you, my girl?'
And she said no, she wouldn't, but then she added,
'With my soul full of Art, mother, I always can have
my resources,' and that is where Marion believes, that
if she were so unlucky as to be crossed in love, she
would have the advantage of you, Miss Wickham, for
you have plainly said that you have no soul for h'Art."</p>

<p>"All that talk of Art makes me downright sick,"
here interrupted Mrs. Fanning. "That's where I
admire you, Miss Wickham. You are very nice to
look at, and you have no nonsense about you, and
it's my belief that you never cared twopence about
that high-falutin' young man, and that now he has
gone, you'll just know where your bread is buttered.
Sit along side of me, dear, and we will have a little
discourse about Albert, it's some time since we had
a good round talk about my dear and godly son."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="s08">A DASH OF ONIONS</span></h2>

<p>It was about a fortnight later that one afternoon,
soon after lunch, Mrs. Fanning came into the drawing-room.
She was somewhat short-sighted, and she
stood in the middle of the room, looking round her.
After a time, to my great horror, she caught sight
of me. If I had a moment to spare, I should have
got behind the curtain, in order to avoid her, but
I had not that moment; she discovered her prey,
and made for me as fast as an arrow from a bow.</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, "here you are; I am going out
driving in Albert's brougham this afternoon. You
didn't know, perhaps, that Albert had a brougham
of his own?"</p>

<p>"I did not," I answered.</p>

<p>"It is a recent acquisition of his; he is becoming a
wealthy man is Albert, and he started the brougham
a short time ago. He had the body painted red and
the wheels dark brown&mdash;I was for having the wheels
yellow, because I like something distinct, but Albert
said, 'No, <i>she</i> would rather have dark brown.' Who
do you think he meant by <i>she</i>, now? That's the
puzzle I am putting to you. Who do you think <i>she</i> is?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<p>"You, of course," I answered boldly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fanning favoured me with a broad wink.</p>

<p>"Ah now, that's very nice of you," she said, "but
the old mother doesn't come in anywhere when the
young girl appears on the horizon. It is about time
for Albert to be meeting the young girl, and meet
her he will. Indeed, it is my opinion that he has
met her, and that the brougham which she likes is
standing at the door. It is for the sake of that
young girl he has had those wheels painted brown,
it is not the wish of his old mother. But come for
a drive with me, will you, dear?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry," I began.</p>

<p>"Oh no, I am not going to take any refusal. Ah,
there is your precious dear mother coming into the
room."</p>

<p>Before I could interrupt her, Mrs. Fanning had
gone to meet my mother. She never walked in the
ordinary sense of the word, she waddled. She
waddled now in her stiff brown satin across the
drawing-room, and stood before mother.</p>

<p>"And how are you feeling this morning, Mrs. Wickham?"
she said; "ah! but poorly, I can tell by the
look of your face, you are dreadfully blue round
the lips, it's the effect of indigestion, isn't it, now?"</p>

<p>"I have suffered a good deal lately from indigestion,"
replied mother in her gentle tones.</p>

<p>"And a bad thing it is, a very bad thing," said
Mrs. Fanning. "I cured myself with Williams'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
Pink Pills for Pale People. Did you ever try 'em,
Mrs. Wickham?"</p>

<p>"No," replied mother gravely.</p>

<p>"Well, well, they pulled me round. Albert was
terribly concerned about me a year ago. I couldn't
fancy the greatest dainties you could give me, I
turned against my food, and as to going upstairs, why,
if you'll believe me, I could have no more taken
possession of that attic next to your young daughter
than I could have fled. Now there ain't a stair in
Britain would daunt me; I'd be good for climbing
the Monument any fine morning, and it's all owing
to Williams' Pink Pills. They're a grand medicine.
But what I wanted to say to you now was this:
May Miss Wickham come for a drive with me in
my son's own brougham? I am anxious to have
an outing with her, and I see by her face she is
desirous to come; may she? Say yes, madam; if
you are wise, you will."</p>

<p>I saw that mother was becoming a little excited
and a little agitated, and I knew that that would
never do, so I said hastily&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't worry mother, please, Mrs. Fanning; I will
certainly come with you for an hour or so."</p>

<p>"We won't be back in an hour, dear," said Mrs.
Fanning, "nor for two hours; we are going to enjoy
ourselves with a tea out. You'll spare your daughter
until she comes back, won't you, madam? I mean
you won't fret about her."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span></p>

<p>I was just about absolutely to refuse, when Miss
Mullins came into the room. To my astonishment
and disgust she came straight over to where we were
talking, and immediately took Mrs. Fanning's part.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," she said, "you must not disappoint
dear Mrs. Fanning, Westenra; she was so looking
forward to having a time out with you. Go with
her. As to your mother, I will look after her. I
have nothing at all to do this afternoon, and mean
to go and sit with her in the drawing-room, or rather
to bring her into my private room, where we will
have a cosy tea to ourselves."</p>

<p>There was no help for it. After Jane's treachery
in siding with Mrs. Fanning, I could only have refused
by making a fuss, which would have been
extremely bad for mother, so I went upstairs and
spent a little time considering in which of my
hats I looked worst, and which of my jackets presented
the most dowdy appearance. Alack and
alas! I had no dowdy jackets and no unbecoming
hats. I put on, however, the quietest I could find,
and ran downstairs. Mrs. Fanning was waiting for
me in the hall. One of the servants of the establishment
was standing near with a heavy fur rug
over her arm. Mrs. Fanning was attired in a huge
sealskin cape, which went down below her knees,
and a bonnet with a large bird of paradise perched
on one side of the brim. She had a veil, with huge
spots on it, covering her broad face, and she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
drawing on a pair of gloves a great deal too small
for her fat hands.</p>

<p>"Here you are, Miss Wickham," she said; "now,
then, we'll go. Open the door, please, Emma."</p>

<p>Emma did so, and we entered the carriage.</p>

<p>"Spread the rug, Emma," said Mrs. Fanning in a
lordly tone. This was also accomplished, and the
next moment we were whirling away. Mrs. Fanning
laid her fat hand on my lap.</p>

<p>"Now, this is pleasant," she said; "I have been
looking forward to this. Do you know where I am
going to take you?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I cannot tell," I answered; "but as
we are out, I hope you will let me look at the shops;
I want to tell mother something about the latest
fashions; it often entertains her."</p>

<p>"Well, I am glad to hear you speak in that
strain, it sounds so human and womanly. Your
tastes and mine coincide to a nicety. There's no
one loves shop-gazing better than I do; I have flattened
my nose against shop windows times and
again, as long as I can remember. Before my dear
Albert became so wealthy, I used to get into my
bus, and do my hour of shop-gazing a-most every
afternoon, but now it fidgets the coachman if I ask
him to pull up the horses too often. You like
the swing of the carriage, don't you, my dear? It's
very comfortable, isn't it? nearly as nice as if it had
the yellow wheels that Albert would not gratify his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
old mother by allowing. Ah, <span class="smcap">SHE</span> has a deal to answer
for&mdash;a deal to answer for&mdash;however nice she may be
in herself." Here Mrs. Fanning favoured me with
one of her broadest winks.</p>

<p>"The carriage is very nice," I replied.</p>

<p>"I fancied somehow that it would suit you, and I
was most anxious to see how you looked in it.
Some people don't look as if they were born to a
carriage, others take to it like a duck takes to the
water. Now, you look very nice in it; you and
your mother in this carriage would look as genteel
as two ladies could look. You don't know what a
great admiration I have for your mother. She is
one of the most beautiful women on God's earth."</p>

<p>"And one of the best," I said impulsively, and as
I thought of all that was going to happen to that
most precious mother, and how soon that presence
would be withdrawn from our mortal gaze, and how
soon that spirit would go to the God who gave it,
tears sprang to my eyes, and even Mrs. Fanning
became more tolerable.</p>

<p>"Ah, you are feeling cut to bits about her great
delicacy," said that good lady. "Any one can see
that; but cheer up, cheer up, the young ought to
rejoice, and you of all women under the sun have
the most cause for rejoicement, Miss Wickham."</p>

<p>I did not ask her why, I did not dare, we drove
on. It seemed to me that we were not going anywhere
near the shops, we were steadily pursuing our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
way into the suburbs. After a drive of over an
hour, we suddenly found ourselves in a part of
Highgate quite unknown to me. We had been
going uphill for some time, and we stopped now
before some iron gates; a woman ran out of a lodge
and opened the gates, and then we drove down a
short avenue shaded by some fine trees. We drew
up in front of a large, substantial red-brick house,
the door of which was open, and on the steps stood
Mr. Fanning. He ran down to meet us, with both
his hands extended.</p>

<p>"Ah! and you have brought the little thing," he
said to his mother.</p>

<p>"What little thing?" I said to myself. This was
really the final straw. I had never, never even by
my most intimate friends, been spoken of as the
"little thing," for I was a tall girl and somewhat
large in my ideas, and if anything rather masculine
in my mind, and to be spoken of as a little thing,
and by Albert Fanning, was about the final straw
which broke the camel's back. My first intention
was to refuse to budge from the carriage, to fiercely
demand that the coachman should turn round and
drive me straight back again to mother, but on
second thoughts, I reflected that I should lose a
good deal of dignity by this proceeding, and the
best possible plan was to appear as if nothing at
all extraordinary had occurred, and to follow Mrs.
Fanning into the house.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I have brought her," said that good woman;
"here she is. She looks slim beside your old mother,
eh! Albert? but she's young; as time goes on she'll
spread like all the rest of us. Well, and here we are,
and she likes the brougham extremely; don't you, my
dear? I could see that if you had yielded to me
with regard to the yellow wheels she would not have
approved. We must all humour her while she is
young; it is always the way, always the way, ain't it,
Albert? And I never saw a girl look nicer in a
brougham than she does. She did enjoy her drive;
it was lovely to see her. Well, now, she'll enjoy still
more what's before her&mdash;the house and the grounds.
It's a bit of a surprise we have for you, my dear," continued
the old lady, turning to me. "It is not every
girl would have the luck to be brought here by <i>his</i>
mother; but everything that can be made easy and
pleasant for you, Miss Wickham, shall be made easy
and pleasant. It was Albert's wish that you should
come here with me, and he said you would much
rather it was not bragged about at the boarding-house
beforehand. This is my son Albert's new house, furnished
according to his own taste, which is excellent,
nothing showy nor gimcrack, all firm and good, bought
at Maple's, dear, in Tottenham Court Road, and the
very best the establishment could furnish. Everything
new, shining, and <i>paid</i> for, dear, paid for. You
can see the bills, not a debt to hang over your head
by-and-by, love. But come in, come in."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>

<p>I really felt that I could not stand much longer
on the steps of the mansion, listening to this most
extraordinary address made to me by Mrs. Fanning.
What did it matter to me whether Albert Fanning
paid for his household goods or not? and how could
it concern me what shop he chose to buy them at?
But I felt myself more or less in a trap, and knew
the best way to prevent any crisis taking place was
to put on an assumed air of absolute indifference,
and to take the first possible opportunity of returning
home.</p>

<p>"Jane must get the Fannings to leave to-morrow,
whatever happens," I said to myself, "and I must
cling now to Mrs. Fanning for dear life. I don't
suppose Albert Fanning will propose for me while
she is by." But alas! I little knew the couple with
whom I had to deal. Albert Fanning had willed
that I was not to cling close to his mother. Turning
to the old lady, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You're fagged and flustered. You have done
things uncommonly well, and now you'll just have
the goodness to sit with your feet on the fender in
the drawing-room, and give yourself a right good
toasting while Miss Wickham and I are examining
the house."</p>

<p>"Oh no," I began.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Mrs. Fanning; "don't be shy,
love." She gave me another wink so broad that I
did not dare to expostulate further. Had I done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
so, Albert would probably have gone on his knees
on the spot and implored of me there and then to
make him the happiest of men.</p>

<p>Accordingly we all entered the drawing-room
which was furnished <i>à la</i> Maple. It was a large
room, and there were a great many tables about,
and I wondered how stout Mrs. Fanning could cross
the room without knocking over one or two. She
looked round her with admiration.</p>

<p>"It's amazing the taste you have," she said, gazing
at her son as if he were a sort of demigod. He put
her into a comfortable chair by the fire, and then he
and I began to do the house. Was there ever such
a dreadful business? We began at the attics, and
we thoroughly explored room after room. I did not
mind that. As long as I could keep Albert Fanning
off dangerous ground I was quite ready to talk to
him. I was ready to poke at the mattresses on the
new beds, and to admire the chain springs, and to
examine the ventilators in the walls of every single
room. I said "Yes" to all his remarks, and he
evidently thought he was making a most favourable
impression. We took a long time going over the
house, but I did not mind that, for Mr. Fanning
was in his element, and was so pleased with his own
consummate common sense and his own skill in getting
the right things into the right corners, and in
showing me what a mind he had for contriving and
for making money go as far as possible, that I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
allowed him to talk to his heart's content. The
brougham must soon be ordered again, and we must
get back to town, and the awful time would be at an
end. But when at last even the kitchens had been
inspected, and the action of the new range explained
to me, Albert said that he must now show me the
grounds. There was no escaping this infliction, and
accordingly into the grounds we went.</p>

<p>These were fairly spacious. There was a large
fruit garden, and a kitchen garden behind it, and
Albert Fanning told me exactly what he was going
to plant in the kitchen garden in the spring&mdash;a
certain bed in particular was to be devoted to spring
onions. He told me that he hated salad without a
good dash of onion in it, and as he spoke he looked
at me as much as to say, "Don't you ever give me
salad without onion," and I began to feel the queerest
sensation, as if I was being mastered, creeping over
me. I wondered if the man really intended to take
me from the garden to the church, where the priest
would be waiting to perform the ceremony which
would tie us together for life. The whole proceeding
was most extraordinary, but just at the crucial
moment, just when I was feeling that I could bear
things no longer, I heard Mrs. Fanning's cheery
voice. How I loved the old lady at that moment!</p>

<p>"Albert! Albert!" she called out, "the tea is
cooling. I don't approve of tea being drawn too
long, and it has been in the teapot for ten minutes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
Come in this minute, you naughty young folks, come
in and enjoy your tea."</p>

<p>"I am coming," I answered, "I am very hungry
and thirsty."</p>

<p>"Are you?" said Mr. Fanning, looking at me.
"Coming, mother, coming."</p>

<p>I turned to run after the old lady, but he suddenly
put out his hand and caught one of mine, I pulled
it away from him.</p>

<p>"Don't," I said.</p>

<p>"Don't!" he replied; "but I certainly shall. I
mean often to touch you in the future, so what does
it matter my taking your hand now. I hope to have
you near me all day long and every day in the future.
You must have guessed why I brought you out
here."</p>

<p>"I have guessed nothing, except that I am thirsty
and want my tea," I replied. "I cannot talk to you
any longer."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you can," he replied, "and you don't stir
from here until I have had my say. You thought
to escape me that time in the drawing-room a few
weeks back, but you won't now. Don't be angry;
don't look so frightened. I mean well, I mean&mdash;I
cannot tell you what I <i>quite</i> mean when I look at
you, but there, you like the house?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "very well."</p>

<p>"Very well indeed; let me tell you, Miss Wickham,
there isn't a more comfortable house nor a better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
furnished house, nor a better paid-for house in the
length and breadth of the county. And you like
these gardens, eh?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," I said.</p>

<p>"I thought so. Well, now, the fruit garden, and
the kitchen garden, and the pleasure garden, and
the house, and the furniture, and the master of the
house are all at your disposal. There! I have
spoken. You are the one I am wishing to wed;
you are the one I intend to wed. I am wanting
you, and I mean to have you for better, for worse.
I have not the slightest doubt that you have faults,
but I am willing to run the risk of finding them out;
and I have no doubt that I have faults too, but I do
not think that they are too prominent, and, at any
rate, I am a real, downright son of Britain, an
honest, good-hearted, well-meaning man. I believe
in the roast beef of Old England and the beer of
Old England, and the ways of Old England, and I
want an English girl like yourself to be my wife, and
I will treat you well, my dear, and love you well&mdash;yes,
I will love you right well."</p>

<p>Here his voice broke, and a pathetic look came
into his eyes, and I turned away more embarrassed,
and more distressed than ever I was in my life.</p>

<p>"You will have all that heart can desire, little girl,
and your poor, delicate mother, shall come and live
with you in this house; and she and my mother can
have a sitting-room between them. We shall be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
happy quartette, and you shall come to me as soon
as ever you like, the sooner the better. Now you
need not give me your answer yet. We know, of
course, what it will be; it is a great chance for you,
and I am not denying it, but come and enjoy your
tea."</p>

<p>"But I must and will give you my answer now,"
I replied. "How can you for a single moment
imagine that I can seriously consider your offer? It
is kind of you; yes, it is kind of any man to give
his whole heart to a girl; and, I believe, you are
sincere, but I can only give you one answer, Mr.
Fanning."</p>

<p>"And that?" he said.</p>

<p>"It is quite&mdash;quite absolutely impossible! I
could never love you; I could never, never marry
you. I am sorry, of course, but I have nothing&mdash;nothing
more to say."</p>

<p>"You mean," said Albert Fanning, turning pale,
and a queer, half angry, half wild look coming and
going on his face, "that you <i>refuse</i> me&mdash;me, and my
house, and my brougham, and my gardens, and my
paid-for furniture! Is it true?"</p>

<p>"I refuse you, and all that you want to confer
upon me," I answered. "I know you mean well,
and I am&mdash;oh, yes, I <i>am</i> obliged to you. Any girl
ought to be obliged to a man who offers her the
best he has; but I could never under any circumstances
marry you. Now, you know."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<p>"You will rue it, and I do not think you mean
it," he said. His face turned red, then purple, he
turned on his heel, and allowed me to walk back to
the house alone.</p>

<p>My head was swimming. My eyes were full of
smarting tears which I dared not shed. I entered
the drawing-room where Mrs. Fanning was waiting
for me.</p>

<p>"Ah! here you are," she cried, rubbing her hands,
and speaking in a very cheerful tone; "and where
is Albert? Has he&mdash;has he?&mdash;why, what is the
matter, my love?"</p>

<p>"I must tell you the truth," I answered, "for I
know you will guess it. Your son has been kind
enough to ask me to marry him. You knew he
meant to ask me, did you not? but I&mdash;I have
refused him. No, I don't want any tea; I don't
want even to go back in the brougham. I can
never, never marry your son, Mrs. Fanning; and
you must have known it&mdash;and it was very unkind
of you to bring me here without saying anything
about it." And then I sank on the nearest chair,
and sobbed as if my heart would break.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="s08">BUTTERED BREAD</span></h2>

<p>Mrs. Fanning let me cry for a moment or two without
interrupting me. I think in her way she had
plenty of heart; for once when I raised my head,
feeling relieved from the bitter flow of those tears, I
found that she was looking at me with a quizzical,
but by no means unkindly glance.</p>

<p>"We'll say nothing about this at present," she
exclaimed; "you shan't be plagued, my dear. I'll
talk to Albert, and say that you are not to be
worried; but whether you take him in the long run
or not, you want your tea now. Come, child, drink
up this nice cup of hot tea."</p>

<p>As she spoke she squeezed herself on to the sofa
by my side; and gave me tea according to her taste,
and insisted on my drinking it; and I could not refuse
her, although my sobs were still coming heavily.</p>

<p>"Ah, you're a proud young girl," she said, "you're
one of those who do not know which side their bread
is buttered; but you will some day, the knowledge
will come to you, and soon, I'm thinking, soon."</p>

<p>Here she looked intensely mysterious, and nodded
her head emphatically.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span></p>

<p>"And there's not a better fellow in the length and
breadth of England than my son, Albert," she continued;
"there's no one who would give his wife a
better time. Kind, he would be to her; firm, he
would be no doubt too. He would make her obey
him, but he would make her love him too. You will
know all about it by-and-by, my dear, all about it
by-and-by. For the present we'll say nothing more.
Albert shan't drive with us back in the brougham,
although I know he meant to do so. Poor fellow!
could love go further; his legs cramped up on that
little seat at the back, but love feels no pain, dear;
no more than pride feels pain. It's a bit of a shock
to you, I know. Proposals always are; that is, to
modest girls. I felt terribly flustered when Albert's
father asked me to marry him. I assure you, my
love, I could not bear the sight of him for the next
fortnight. I used to say, whenever he entered a
room, 'I'm going out, Albert, if you're coming in.
Get right away now, if you don't want me to hate
you for ever,' but, in the end, my dear love, I was
head over ears in love with him. There never was
a better husband. He would be masterful as a good
man should; but, dear, I worshipped the ground he
trod on, and it was he who made the beginning of
that fortune which Albert has turned into so big a
thing. Well, my love, you have seen the house, and
you have gone over the grounds, and you have done
something else. You have looked into the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
good heart of my son, Albert; and after a time, I
have no doubt, you will creep into that heart, and
take refuge; but mum's the word at present, mum's
the word."</p>

<p>The idea of my creeping into Albert's heart as a
final cave of refuge was so funny, that I could
scarcely keep back my smiles; and I almost became
hysterical between laughing and crying, so much so,
that Mrs. Fanning had to put her arms round me
and hug me, and call me her dear little girl.</p>

<p>I was very glad she did not say, "dear little
thing." By-and-by she ordered the carriage, and
we went back to town. She was most affectionate
to me. She assured me many times that she quite
understood; that she had gone through precisely the
same phases with regard to Albert Fanning the first
but that it had all come right, and that her passion
for the godly man had been very strong by-and-by.
I should feel just the same with regard to Albert the
second. It was the way of girls; that is, nice girls.</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me about that Miss Marion Armstrong,"
she said. "The ways of that girl turn me
sick. It is the contrast you make to Marion Armstrong
which has done the business more than anything
else, my dear Miss Wickham. But there,
dear, there we'll turn the conversation."</p>

<p>"I earnestly wish you would," I said</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, "how history repeats itself. I
used to feel as if I would like to box any one in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
face who talked to me about my dear Albert long
ago. But oh, how I loved him before all was over,
how I loved him!"</p>

<p>She almost shed tears at the recollection. In
short, I had a most unpleasant drive home. At last
it was over. I got out of the brougham, with its
red body and chocolate wheels, and staggered rather
than walked into the house. I did not dare to see
mother until all traces of emotion had left my face,
but I made straight for Jane's sanctum.</p>

<p>"Jane," I said the moment I found myself there,
"the Fannings must go away; they must, Jane, they
must."</p>

<p>"Why so?" asked Jane.</p>

<p>"I will tell you what has just happened. Mother
must never know, but I must tell some one. Mrs.
Fanning took me into the country in their new
brougham. We went to Highgate; they have a
house there. Mr. Fanning was there to meet us. He
called me a little thing, and he took me over the
house and over the grounds, and told me, on pain of
his direst displeasure, that I was never to give him
salad without onions, and then he asked me to <i>marry
him</i>. O Jane! what is to be done?"</p>

<p>"But didn't you always know that he was going
to ask you?" inquired Jane in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Ask me to marry him! How could I suppose
anything so preposterous?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Well, dear, I know it goes very sore with you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
and I hope, with all my heart and soul, that it may
not be necessary."</p>

<p>"Necessary!" I said, "what do you mean? O
Jane! don't talk in that way, you'll drive me mad.
I cannot stay in the house with the Fannings any
more."</p>

<p>"Let me think for a moment," answered Jane.
She looked very careworn and distressed, her face
had grown thin and haggard. She looked years
older than before we had started the boarding-house.
I was quite sorry to see the change in her face.</p>

<p>"Our life does not suit you," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, it suits me well enough," she replied, "and
I never leave a sinking ship."</p>

<p>"But why should this ship be sinking? I thought
we were doing so well, the house is almost always full."</p>

<p>"It is just this," said Jane: "we charged too little
when we started. If the house was choke-full, all
the attics and the three different floors let, we could
not make the thing pay, that's the awful fact, and
you ought to know it, Westenra. We should have
begun by charging more."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't we?" I said. "I left all
those matters to you, Jane. I was very ignorant,
and you came and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not blaming you, my dear Westenra," said
Jane; "only it is very, very hard to go on toiling, toiling
all day and almost all night, and to feel at the same
time that the thing cannot pay, that it can never pay."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>

<p>"But why didn't we begin by charging more, and
why can't we charge more now?"</p>

<p>"Because people who live in Bloomsbury never
pay more," answered Miss Mullins, "that is it, dear.
If we meant this thing to succeed we should have
started our boarding-house in Mayfair, and then
perhaps we might have had a chance of managing.
Perhaps with a connection like yours we could have
made it pay."</p>

<p>"Never," I said, "none of our friends would come
to us, they would have been scandalised. It would
never have done, Jane."</p>

<p>"Well, well, we have got ourselves into a trap,
and we must get out the best way we can," was
Jane's lugubrious answer.</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind about our being in money difficulties
now," I cried, "do think of me, Jane, just for
a moment, do make things possible for me. Remember
that I am very young, and I was never
accustomed to people of the Fanning type. Do, I
beseech of you, ask them to go. Mr. Fanning's
action to-day will make your request possible. Jane,
if I went on my knees and stayed there all my life,
I could not marry him, and the sooner he knows it
the better."</p>

<p>"I will think things over," said Jane. I never
saw anything like the look of despair which was
creeping over her face.</p>

<p>"Things are coming to a crisis," she continued, "and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
I must confide in you fully, but not just now, we
must get dinner over first. Your mother was ill while
you were away, she won't come to dinner to-night."</p>

<p>"Mother ill! Anything serious?" I cried in
alarm.</p>

<p>"Only a little faintness. I have got her comfortably
to bed."</p>

<p>"Well, of course, I shan't dine to-night, I shall
stay with mother."</p>

<p>"But you must, my love, it is absolutely necessary
that you should appear at dinner, and you
must be quite cheerful too in her room. She is quite
herself now, and is looking over a new book, and
when you go to her you will see that she has had a
nice dinner, nourishing and suitable. Now go and
change your dress, and make yourself look smart.
Now that Mr. Randolph is gone, and your mother is
too ill to be often in the drawing-room and dining-room,
the affairs of the household rest upon you.
You must make yourself smart; you must make
yourself attractive. It must be done, Westenra, it
must, and for your mother's sake."</p>

<p>Jane spoke with such determination that she
stimulated my courage, and I went away to my
own room determined to act on her advice.</p>

<p>At the other side of the wall I heard Mrs. Fanning's
heavy steps as she walked about. She did
not seem to be at all depressed at my refusal of her
son Albert. On the contrary, she was in very good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
spirits. She had been in excellent spirits all the
way back, and had kept on assuring me that I was
only going on the usual tack of the modest maiden,
the maiden who was worthy of such a man as
her godly son Albert. Had not she herself hated
Albert's father for a whole fortnight after his proposal,
and had she not been glad, very glad, in the
end to creep into his great heart for shelter? Did
she suppose that I also would be glad to creep into
Albert the second's great heart for shelter? Oh, it
was all unbearable. But, nevertheless, there was a
spirit of defiance in me. I had tried my ugly dresses
in vain, I had tried being grave and distant in vain.
I had tried everything, but nothing had availed;
Mr. Fanning was determined to have me for his
wife. I wondered if the man cared for me, perhaps
he did after his fashion, but as no self-denials on my
part had the effect of repulsing him, I would give
way to my fancy and dress properly for dinner. I
put on a very pretty pink dress which I had not yet
worn, and ran downstairs.</p>

<p>At dinner I sat opposite Mr. Fanning. Mother's
place was empty, and Mrs. Fanning called across the
table to know what was the matter with her.</p>

<p>I said that she was tired and had gone to bed,
whereupon Mrs. Armstrong immediately remarked,
that it was a very good thing we had such an excellent
housekeeper as Miss Mullins to look after
things in my mother's serious state of health,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
otherwise the house would go to wreck and ruin,
she said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Armstrong looked daggers at me for wearing
my pink dress. She had never seen anything so
stylish as that soft, graceful robe before, and between
her jealousy at seeing me so attired, and her
earnest wish to copy it for Marion, she scarcely
knew what to do with herself. She darted angry
glances at my face, and then tried to measure with
her eye the amount of ribbon on the bodice, and the
quantity of chiffon round the neck. But Mr. Fanning,
to my great relief and delight, did not appear
to take the slightest interest in me. I do not think
he once glanced at my pretty evening frock. He
absorbed himself altogether with Marion Armstrong.
He talked to her all during dinner, and invited her
in a loud voice to come and see him at his office on
the following day.</p>

<p>"I told you, Miss Armstrong," he said, "that as a
rule I am brutal to the people who come to me
trying to sell their wares. Those silly folks who
bring their useless manuscripts and their poor little
amateur drawings to my office find that I make
short work with them.</p>

<p>"'If you like to leave your manuscript or your
drawings,' I say to them, 'you can do so, but as to
the chance of their being accepted, well, look for
yourselves. Do you see that pile? all that pile of
manuscripts has to be read before yours. If you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
leave your manuscripts they go under the pile at
the bottom; there will be nearly a ton of stuff on
top of them. You take your chance. You had
best go away at once with what you have brought,
for I am not likely to require it.' They mostly do
go away, Miss Armstrong, for I am brutal in my
words and brutal in my tone. There is no use in
buoying people up with false hopes." Here he gave
a loud guffaw, which reached my ears at the further
end of the table.</p>

<p>Captain Furlong bent across at that moment to
say something to me, and I saw that he was much
displeased at Mr. Fanning's loud, aggressive words.
But Mr. Fanning, after all, was nothing to Mrs.
Fanning. It was quite pleasant to me to see that
he should turn his attentions to Miss Marion Armstrong,
but Mrs. Fanning's winks were more than I
could endure. They were just as much as to say,
"Listen to him now; he is only doing that to draw
you on." So plainly did her speaking eyes announce
this fact, that I dreaded each moment her saying
the awful words aloud, but fortunately she did not
go quite so far as that.</p>

<p>When dinner was over Mrs. Armstrong came and
sat near me.</p>

<p>"Have you seen any of Marion's drawings lately?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"No," I replied; "is she getting on well?"</p>

<p>"Is she getting on well!" retorted Mrs. Armstrong.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
"The girl is a genius. I told you before
that her whole soul was devoted to h'Art. Well, I
may as well say now that she has sold a little set of
drawings to Mr. Fanning. He means to bring them
out in his Christmas number of the <i>Lady's Handbag</i>.
Have you ever seen the <i>Lady's Handbag</i>, Miss
Wickham?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered; "I cannot say that I have."</p>

<p>"I am surprised to hear it. The <i>Lady's Handbag</i>
is one of the most striking and widely read periodicals
of the day. It contains information on every
single thing that a lady ought to know, and there is
nothing in it for those low-down common sort of
people who want wild excitement and sickening
adventures. But you shall see it for yourself.
Marion! Come here, dear Marion."</p>

<p>Marion, behind whose chair Mr. Fanning was
standing, rose reluctantly and crossed the room
with a frown between her brows.</p>

<p>"You will scarcely believe it, Marion, but Miss
Wickham has not seen the <i>Lady's Handbag</i>. I was
just telling her that you are to illustrate an article
for the Christmas number. Perhaps you could
oblige me by bringing a number here. I know Miss
Wickham would like to see any of Mr. Fanning's
publications."</p>

<p>Miss Armstrong left the room and returned with
a copy of the <i>Lady's Handbag</i>. It was handed to
me and I turned the pages. It was exactly the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
sort of fifth-rate production which I should expect
a man of Mr. Fanning's calibre to initiate.</p>

<p>I gave it back to Mrs. Armstrong.</p>

<p>"I am so glad that Miss Armstrong is having her
first success," I said then, and I thought what a
suitable and admirable wife she would make for
Mr. Fanning, and hoped that he might by-and-by
think so himself.</p>

<p>As I was entering my own room that night,
Mrs. Fanning popped her head out of her own door
near by.</p>

<p>"One word, Miss Wickham," she said. She
looked very funny. She had divested herself of her
gay dress and was wearing a night-cap. Her night-cap
had large frills which partly encircled her wide
face.</p>

<p>"I know you're fretted by the way Albert has gone
on this evening," she said, "but he's only doing it
on purpose. I am sorry for that poor girl, though.
You had better be quick and make up your mind,
or Marion Armstrong will fall over head and ears in
love with him, but if you imagine for a single
moment that he thinks sincerely of her you are
greatly mistaken. It's you he wants, and you he'll
have. Go to bed now, dear, and dream of him, but
I understand your ways perfectly. I felt just the
same about Albert the first."

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="s08">YOU USED TO LOVE US</span></h2>

<p>Mother was very ill for the next few days, and I
was so much occupied with her that I had no time
to think of either Mr. or Mrs. Fanning. When I
was in the drawing-room my heart was full of her;
when I forced myself to go to meals, I could only
think of her dear face. Was she going to be taken
away from me before the year was up? Oh, surely
God would at least leave me my one treasure for
that short time. In those days I used to go away
by myself and struggle to pray to God, but my heart
was heavy, and I wondered if He heard my restless
and broken words. I used to creep out sometimes
and go into a church alone, and try to picture what
my future would be when mother was gone; but I
could not picture it. It always rose before me as a
great blank, and I could not see anything distinctly.
It seemed to me that I could see everything when
mother was present, and nothing without her. And
then I would go back again to her room and rouse
myself to be cheerful, and to talk in a pleasant tone.
I was doing the utmost that duty required of me
just then. I determined that nothing would induce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
me to look further afield. Life without mother I did
not dare to contemplate. But there were moments
when the thought of one person came to my heart
with a thrill of strength and comfort. I missed Jim
Randolph, and longed for him to come back.</p>

<p>As the winter passed away and the spring approached,
I began to hope for his return. I began
to feel that when once he was back things would
be right, anxiety would be removed from Jane's face,
the strain would be removed. Mother would have
her friend near her, and I also should not be friendless
when my time of terrible trouble came, for of
course mother was dying. The doctor was right.
It was a question perhaps of days, of months at
most, but if Mr. Randolph came back I thought that
I could bear it.</p>

<p>When mother and I were alone I noticed that she
liked to talk of Jim, and I was more than willing to
listen to her, and to draw her out, and to ask her
questions, for it seemed to me that she knew him a
great deal better than I did.</p>

<p>"There always seems to be a mystery surrounding
him," I said on one occasion. "You know much
more than I do. I like him, of course, and I am
sure you like him, mother."</p>

<p>"Except your dear father, West," replied mother,
"he is the best fellow I ever met, and he will come
back again, dearest. I shall be very glad when he
comes back. We ought to hear from him soon now."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span></p>

<p>The winter was now passing away and the spring
coming, and the spring that year happened to be a
mild and gracious one, without much east wind, and
with many soft westerly breezes, and the trees in the
Square garden put on their delicate fragile green
clothing, and hope came back to my heart once more.</p>

<p>One day I had gone to do some messages for
mother in Regent Street. She had asked me to buy
some lace for a new fichu, and one or two other little
things. I went off to fulfil my messages with my
heart comparatively light.</p>

<p>I went to Dickins &amp; Jones', and was turning over
some delicate laces at the lace counter when a hand
was laid on my shoulder. I turned with a start to
encounter the kind old face of the Duchess of Wilmot.</p>

<p>"My dear Westenra," she said, "this is lucky.
How are you? I have heard nothing of you for a
long time."</p>

<p>Now, I had always loved the Duchess, not at all
because she was a duchess, but because she was a
woman with a very womanly heart and a very sweet
way, and my whole heart went out to her now&mdash;to
her gracious appearance, to her gentle, refined tone
of voice, to the look in her eyes. I felt that I belonged
to her set, and her set were delightful to me
just then.</p>

<p>"Where are you going," inquired the Duchess,
"after you have made your purchases?"</p>

<p>"Home again," I answered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span></p>

<p>"My carriage is at the door; you shall come with
me. You shall come and have tea with me."</p>

<p>"I have not time," I said. "Mother is not well,
and I must hurry back to her."</p>

<p>"Your mother not well! Mary Wickham not
well! I have heard nothing for months. I have
written two or three times, but my letters have not
been replied to. It is impossible to keep up a friendship
of this sort, all on one side, Westenra. And
you don't look as well as you did, and oh! my dear
child, is that your spring hat?"</p>

<p>"It is; it will do very well," I answered. I spoke
almost brusquely; I felt hurt at her remarking it.</p>

<p>"But it is not fresh. It is not the sort of hat I should
like my god-daughter to wear. They have some pretty
things here. I must get you a suitable hat."</p>

<p>"No, no," I said with passion. "It cannot be."</p>

<p>"You are so ridiculously proud and so ridiculously
socialistic in all your ideas. But if you were a true
Socialist you would take a present from your old
friend without making any fuss over the matter."</p>

<p>As the Duchess spoke she looked at me, and I saw
tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>"And I am your godmother," she continued. "I
do not like to see you looking as you do. You want
a new hat and jacket; may I get them for you?"</p>

<p>At first I felt that I must refuse, but then I reflected
that it would please mother to see me in the
hat and jacket which the Duchess would purchase.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
I knew that the buying of such things were a mere
bagatelle to her, and the little pleasure which the
new smart things would give mother were not a
bagatelle. My own feelings must be crushed out of
sight. I said humbly, "Just as you like." So the
Duchess hurried me into another room, and a hat
that suited me was tried on and paid for, and then
a new jacket was purchased, and the Duchess made
me put on both hat and jacket immediately, and
gave the address of 17 Graham Square to have my
old things sent to.</p>

<p>The next moment we were bowling away in her
carriage.</p>

<p>"Ah," she cried, "now you look more like yourself.
Pray give that old hat to the housemaid. Don't
put it on again. I mean to drive you home now,
Westenra."</p>

<p>"Thank you," I answered.</p>

<p>"I mean to see your mother also. Is she seriously
ill?"</p>

<p>"She is," I replied. I lowered my eyes and dropped
my voice.</p>

<p>"But what is the matter, my poor child? You
seem very sad."</p>

<p>"I have a great deal to make me sad, but I cannot
tell you too much now, and you must not question
me."</p>

<p>"And Jim has gone, really?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Randolph has gone."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span></p>

<p>The Duchess seemed about to speak, but she
closed her lips.</p>

<p>"He wrote and told me he had to go, but he will come
back again. When did you say he went, Westenra?"</p>

<p>"I did not say, Duchess."</p>

<p>"But give me the date, dear, please, and be quick."</p>

<p>I thought for a moment.</p>

<p>"He left England on the 30th of November," I said.</p>

<p>"Ah, and this is the 15th of March. What a nice
genial spring we are having. He will be home soon;
I am sure of that."</p>

<p>"Have you heard from him?" I asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"Just a line <i>en route</i>. I think it was dated from
Colombo. Have you heard?"</p>

<p>"I believe mother had a letter, and I think Jane
had."</p>

<p>"He has not written to you?"</p>

<p>"No." I felt the colour leap into my cheeks like
an angry flame. I was ashamed of myself for blushing.</p>

<p>The Duchess looked at me attentively, and I saw
a pleased expression in her eyes. That look made
me still more uncomfortable. She bent towards me,
took my hand, and pressed it.</p>

<p>"You like Jim, do you not?" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered very slowly. "I do not know
Mr. Randolph well, but what little I have seen of
him I like. He is courteous, and he thinks of others;
he is very unselfish; he has much sympathy and
tact, too. I think he is very fond of mother."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<p>The Duchess gave the queerest, most inexplicable
of smiles.</p>

<p>"He is a dear fellow," she said. "Westenra,
when you come back to us we will all rejoice."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you," I answered coldly.
"It is impossible for me ever to come back to you.
I have stepped down."</p>

<p>"When you come back we will rejoice," she repeated.</p>

<p>"But I am not coming back. I do not even know
that I want to. If you had come to see mother
sometimes&mdash;mother, who is just as much a lady as
she ever was, who is sweeter and more beautiful than
she ever was&mdash;you might have done us a great service,
and I could have loved you, oh! so dearly; but you
have forsaken us, because we are no longer in your
set. Duchess, I must speak the truth. I hate sets;
I hate distinctions of rank. You used to love us; I
did think your love was genuine. We lived in a
nice house in Mayfair, and you were our great and
kind friend. Now you do not love us, because&mdash;because
we are poor."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, Westenra. I love you still,
and I have never forgotten you. I will not come in
now, but I will come and see your mother to-morrow."</p>

<p>"That will please her," I answered, drying away
the tears which had risen to my eyes. "But please
do not disappoint her. I will tell her of your visit.
Do not keep her waiting. She is weak; she has
been very ill. At what hour will you come?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<p>"About twelve o'clock. But she must be very
bad indeed from the way you speak."</p>

<p>"She is far from well."</p>

<p>"Are you hiding anything from me, Westenra?"</p>

<p>"I am," I replied stoutly. "And you cannot get
my secret from me. When you see mother to-morrow
perhaps you will know without my speaking. Do not
say anything to agitate her."</p>

<p>"My poor, poor child. Westenra, you ought never
to have left us. You do not look well; but never
mind, spring is coming, and Jim Randolph will be
home before May."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="s08">RUINED</span></h2>

<p>It was on the afternoon of that same day that Jane
Mullins sent for me to go into her private sitting-room.</p>

<p>"Shut the door," she said, "I must talk to you."</p>

<p>Really Jane looked most queer. During the last
month or two, ever since Mr. Randolph went away,
she had been taking less and less pains with her
dress; her hair was rough and thinner than ever;
her little round figure had fallen away; she seemed
to have aged by many years. She was never a
pretty woman, never in any sense of the word, but
now there was something grotesque about her, grotesque
and at the same time intensely pathetic.</p>

<p>"I have done all I could," she said. "Lock the
door, please, Westenra."</p>

<p>I locked the door.</p>

<p>"Now come and sit here, or stand by the window,
or do anything you like; but listen with all your
might, keep your attention alert."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "yes."</p>

<p>"We are ruined, Westenra," said Jane Mullins,
"we are ruined."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>

<p>"What!" I cried.</p>

<p>Jane said the words almost ponderously, and then
she threw her hands to her sides and gazed at me with
an expression which I cannot by any possibility describe.</p>

<p>"We are ruined," she repeated, "and it is time
you should know it."</p>

<p>"But how?" I asked.</p>

<p>"How?" she cried with passion, "because we
have debts which we cannot meet&mdash;we have debts,
debts, debts on every side; debts as high as the
house itself. Because we deceived our landlord, unintentionally
it is true, but nevertheless we deceived
him, with promises which we cannot fulfil, he can
take back the lease of this house if he pleases, and
take it back he will, because our paying guests don't
pay, because the whole thing from first to last is a
miserable failure. There, Westenra, that's about the
truth. It was your thought in the first instance,
child, and though I don't want to blame you, for
you did it with good meaning, and in utter ignorance,
yet nevertheless you must take some of the brunt of
this terrible time. I cannot bear the whole weight
any longer. I have kept it to myself, and it has
driven me nearly mad. Yes, we are ruined."</p>

<p>"You must explain more fully," was my answer.</p>

<p>Her agitation was so great that by its very force
it kept me quiet. I had never seen her absolutely
without composure before; her usually brisk, confident
manner had deserted her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<p>"You have kept me in the dark," I continued,
"and you have done wrong, very wrong. Now
please explain how and why we are ruined."</p>

<p>"Here are some of the accounts; understand
them if you can," she said. She opened a drawer
and pulled out a great account book. "Now
look here," she said, "the house is absolutely full,
there is not a single room to be let; I declined
four fresh parties only this morning; Emma is
perfectly tired opening the door to people who want
to come here to board, the house has got a name
and a good one. It is said of it that it is in
Bloomsbury and yet smacks of the West End.
You and your mother and Jim Randolph, bless
him! have to answer for that. It's all your doing,
and the people have talked. Everything has been
done that could be done to make the place popular,
and the place is popular, but now, you look here.
Here are the takings"&mdash;she pointed to one side of
the ledger&mdash;"here are the expenses"&mdash;she pointed to
the other&mdash;"expenses so much, takings so much, look
at the balance, Westenra. Of course you don't know
much about accounts, but you can see for yourself."</p>

<p>I did look, and I did see, and my heart seemed
to stand still, for the balance on the wrong side of
the ledger represented many pounds a week.</p>

<p>"Then this means," I said, for I was sharp enough
in my way, "that the longer we go on the heavier
we get into debt. Every week we lose so much."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span></p>

<p>"We do, dear, that's just it."</p>

<p>"But cannot we retrench?"</p>

<p>"Retrench! how? Do you suppose the boarders
will do without their comfortable hot coffee, and the
other luxuries on the board at breakfast? Do you
suppose they will do without their lunch, their afternoon
tea with plenty of cakes and plenty of cream,
their late dinner, at which appears all the luxuries
of the season?&mdash;why, the house would be empty in
a week. And we cannot have fewer servants, we
have only four, very much less than most people
would have for an establishment of this kind, and
Emma already complains of pains in her legs, and
says she is worn out going up and down stairs."</p>

<p>"But the place looks so thriving," I said.</p>

<p>"Looks! what have looks to do with it?" said
Jane. "I feel nearly mad, for I always thought I
could pull the thing through; but it's going on at a
loss, and nothing can go on at a loss; and then, dear,
there are bad debts&mdash;one or two people have shuffled
off without paying, and there are the furniture bills,
they are not all met yet."</p>

<p>"But I thought," I said, "that the seven thousand
pounds&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay," cried Jane, "and that is where the bitterness
comes in. That money was supposed to be all
right, to be as sure and safe as the Bank of England,
and it is not all right, it is all wrong. But that is
James Randolph's story. When he comes back he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
will explain the rights of it to you, my dear. If I
could only hear from him that the money was safe,
we could wind up honourably in the autumn and
stop the concern; but I have not heard, I have not
heard; there has been nothing but silence, and the
silence drives me mad. Westenra, what is to be
done?"</p>

<p>"Give the whole thing up now," I said, "there is
nothing else to be done. We must stop."</p>

<p>"Stop!" answered Jane. "You talk with the
ignorance of a young girl. If we stop now we will
have the whole house of cards about our ears; the
tradespeople will sue for their money, the bailiffs
will be in and will take possession of the furniture,
even the very bed your mother sleeps on will be
taken from under her. The awful, terrible position
is, that we can neither stop nor go on. It is fearful,
fearful. Oh, if I could only borrow a thousand
pounds within a week, I would not care a farthing.
I would not even care if your mother was strong,
but to have this crash come about her in her present
state of health, why, it would kill her. Westenra,
poor child, you are young and unaccustomed to these
things, but I must unburden my mind. There is
ruin before us; I can scarcely stave it off for another
week, and I have not had a line from Mr. Randolph,
and I am nearly wild."</p>

<p>"And you think a thousand pounds would keep
things going for a little longer," I answered.</p>

<p>"Yes, we could stay on until the end of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
season if I could get that money. It would pay
the quarter's rent, and the tradespeople's bills, and
the big furniture bills. And long before it was out
Mr. Randolph must come back and put everything
straight. His return is what I am hoping for more
than the rising of the sun."</p>

<p>"But oh, Jane, how&mdash;how am I to get the thousand
pounds?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking that Duchess of yours might
lend it."</p>

<p>"No," I said, "I cannot ask her; besides, I know
she would not. Though she is a Duchess she has
not got a lot of money to spare. The Duke manages
everything, and she just has her allowance, and a
great deal to do with it. I cannot ask her."</p>

<p>"There is one other way in which ruin could be
averted," said Jane slowly, "but that I suppose is
not to be thought of. Well, I have told you, and I
suppose it is a sort of relief. Things may go on as
they are for another week or two, but that's about all."</p>

<p>I felt that I trembled, but I would not let Jane see.</p>

<p>"You have been very brave. You have ruined
yourself for our sakes," I cried impulsively. But at
the same time I could not help adding, "That friend
of yours who promised you seven thousand pounds
ought not to have failed you at a critical moment
like the present."</p>

<p>"I won't have him blamed," said Jane, her face
turning crimson; "it is not his fault. Man could
not do more."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<p>"Jane," I said, facing her, "tell me the truth now;
what is the name of your friend?"</p>

<p>"You won't get his name out of me," answered
Jane. "Mr. Randolph has gone to Australia to put
things straight with him. When I hear from Mr.
James Randolph all will be well."</p>

<p>"Have you never heard since he left?"</p>

<p>"Twice during the voyage, but not since. It is
wonderful why he is so silent. There, I seem to
have lost hope."</p>

<p>"Jane," I cried, "why don't you give us up and
go back to your own little house?"</p>

<p>"Bless you, child, I'm not the one to leave a
sinking ship. Oh, we'll go on a little bit longer,
and it has cheered me a little to confide in you. I
will work the ship for another week or so, and there
will be an extra nice dinner to-night, and spring
asparagus, real English grown, and your mother
shall have the greater portion of it. Oh dear, oh
dear, if the house were twice its size we <i>might</i> make
it pay, but as it is it's too big and it's too small;
it's one of the betwixt-and-betweens, and betwixt-and-between
things <i>never</i> do, never, never. Child,
forgive me, I am sorry to add to your cares. If it
were not for your mother I should not mind a bit."</p>

<p>I could do nothing to comfort Jane. I went up
to her and kissed her, and held her hand for a
moment, and then went slowly away to my own
room. I did not attempt to shed a tear, I was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
going to cry just then, it behoved me to be very
brave; there was a great deal to be borne, and if I
gave way it seemed to me that everything must
come to an end. I felt some pride in my young
strength and my courage, and was resolved that
they should not fail me in my hour of need. So I
put away the new hat and pretty jacket and went
down to mother, and I amused mother by showing
her the lace I had bought, and I told her all about
the Duchess, and mother was much pleased at the
thought of seeing her old friend on the following
morning, and she and I sat that afternoon in the
drawing-room making up the pretty lace fichu, and
I resolved that mother should wear it the next day
when the Duchess came.</p>

<p>There was the most awful trouble hanging over
us all; my mother's days on earth were numbered,
and my scheme, my lovely castle in the air, was
falling to ruins about my head. But all the same
mother and I laughed and were cheerful, and the
visitors who came into the drawing-room that afternoon
thought what a picturesque group mother and
I made, and what a lovely room it was, and how
much superior to most boarding-houses; and they
inquired, more than one of them, when there would
be a vacancy, and said they would write to Miss
Mullins on the subject. Poor Jane Mullins! she
was bearing the brunt of the storm. I pitied her
from the depths of my heart.

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="s08">MR. PATTENS</span></h2>

<p>The next day the Duchess called, and mother was
looking so well for her, and so pleased to see her old
friend again, that I do not think at first the Duchess
of Wilmot half realised how ill she was. I just saw
her for a moment, and then went out. I came back
again at the end of an hour. Mother's cheeks were
quite bright, and her eyes shining, and her hand
was in the Duchess's hand, and when she looked at
me her eyes grew brighter than ever, and she said
to me&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come here, darling," and she raised her dear lips
for me to kiss her.</p>

<p>I did kiss those lips, and I thought them too hot,
and I said to the Duchess&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are tiring mother, you have stayed with
her long enough."</p>

<p>"Oh no, let her stay; I do love so much to see
her," said my mother, so I could not have the heart
to say any more, and I went away to a distant part
of the room, and they began whispering again just
like the dearest friends which they really were, and
at last the Duchess came up to me and said&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span></p>

<p>"Come downstairs with, me, West."</p>

<p>I went with her, and wondered why she called me
by mother's pet name, but I loved her very much.</p>

<p>"Tell me the truth about your mother," said the
Duchess as soon as we got into the hall. "At first
I thought her fairly well, but she is feverish, quite
feverish now. Have I overtired her?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you anything except that she is not
strong," I said; "that you have come so seldom to
see her, that you have over-excited her now. Oh, I
cannot wait, I must go back to her."</p>

<p>"I will come again to-morrow or next day," said
the Duchess; "I don't like her appearance at all."</p>

<p>The Duchess went away, and I returned to mother.</p>

<p>"It was nice to see Victoria," said my mother.
"She is just the same as ever, not the least changed.
She told me about all our old friends."</p>

<p>"You are over-excited," I said, "you ought to stay
quiet now."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I am well and hungry; only I
wonder when I shall see her again."</p>

<p>"She said she would come to-morrow or next day,"
I answered.</p>

<p>In the evening mother certainly seemed by no
means worse for the Duchess's visit, and the next
day she said to me, "Victoria will certainly call to-morrow."
But to-morrow came and the Duchess did
not arrive, nor the next day, nor the next, and mother
looked rather fagged, and rather sad and disappointed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
and at the end of a week or fortnight she ceased to
watch anxiously for the sound of wheels in the Square,
and said less and less about her dear friend Victoria.</p>

<p>But just then, the thoughts of every one in the
house except mother (and the news was carefully
kept from her), were full of a great and terrible
catastrophe, and even I forgot all about the Duchess,
for one of our largest Orient liners had foundered
on some sunken rocks not far from Port Adelaide,
off the coast of South Australia, and there had been
a terrific shipwreck, and almost every one on board
was drowned. The vessel was called the <i>Star of Hope</i>.
The papers were all full of it, and the news was on
every one's lips; but just at first I did not realise
how all important, how paralysing this same news
was for us. I read the trouble first in Jane's face.</p>

<p>"You must not let your mother know about the
shipwreck," she said.</p>

<p>"But I cannot keep the newspapers from mother,
and every newspaper is full of it," I replied; "surely,
Jane, surely&mdash;oh, you cannot mean it&mdash;no person
that we know was on board?"</p>

<p>"I have a great fear over me," she answered.</p>

<p>I clutched her arm, and looked into her face with
wild eyes. My own brain seemed to reel, my heart
beat almost to suffocation, then I became quiet.
With a mighty effort I controlled myself.</p>

<p>"Surely," I said, "surely."</p>

<p>"His name is not mentioned amongst the list of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
passengers, that is my one comfort; but it is quite
possible, on the other hand, that he may have gone
on board at Adelaide," she continued, "for I know
he had business close to Adelaide, he told me so.
If that was the case they might not have entered his
name in the ship's list of passengers, and&mdash;oh, I
have a great, a terrible fear over me, his silence, and
now this. Yes, child, it is true, he was, if all had
gone well, to be on his way home about now; but
he has never written, and now this shipwreck. I
am more anxious, far more anxious than I can
say."</p>

<p>That night I did not sleep at all. Thoughts of
Jim Randolph filled my mind to the exclusion of all
hope of repose. Was he really drowned? Had he
left the world? Was I never to see his face again?
There was a cry at my heart, and an ache there
which ought to have told me the truth, and yet I
would not face the truth. I said over and over to
myself, "If he dies, it is terrible; if he dies, it means
ruin for us;" but nevertheless I knew well, although
I would not face the truth, that I was not thinking
of the ruin to the house in Graham Square, nor the
blow to mother, nor the loss of James Randolph
simply as a friend. There was a deeper cause for
my grief. It was useless for me to say to my own
heart Jim Randolph was nothing to me. I knew
well that he was. I knew well that he was more to
me than any one else in the wide world; that I&mdash;yes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
although he had never spoken of his love for me,
I loved him, yes, I loved him with my full heart.</p>

<p>In the morning I made up my mind that I would
go and see the Duchess. Perhaps, too, she might
know something about Jim Randolph, as he was a
friend of hers, a friend about whom she was always
hinting, but about whom she said very little.</p>

<p>As I was leaving the house Jane called me into
her sitting-room.</p>

<p>"Where are you going," she said.</p>

<p>I told her.</p>

<p>"Did you ever think over that idea of mine that
you might ask the Duchess to lend us that thousand
pounds?" she said. "You remember I mentioned it,
and you said you would not do it; but things are
very grave, very grave indeed; and if&mdash;if my fear
about Mr. Randolph is true, why things are graver
than ever, in fact everything is up. But I would
like for <i>her</i> sake, poor dear, for her sake to ward off
the catastrophe as long as possible. She was very
ill last night, and I was up with her for a couple of
hours. I wouldn't disturb you; but didn't you think
yourself that she looked bad this morning?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," I said, the tears starting to my eyes;
"I thought mother looked terribly ill, and I am
going to see the Duchess. She ought to call in
order to make mother happy."</p>

<p>"Shut the door, Westenra," said Jane, "I have
something I must say."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<p>I shut the door, I was trembling. Jane was no
longer a rock of defence, she made me more frightened
than any one else in the house.</p>

<p>"Oh, what is it?" I said; "don't be mysterious,
do speak out."</p>

<p>"Well, it is this," said Jane, "we want that thousand
pounds just dreadfully. If we had it we could go
on, we could go on at least till the end of the season,
and there would be an excuse to take your mother
to the country, and she might never know, never;
but it wants two months to the end of the season,
and the house is full, and every one is in the height
of good humour, and yet they are all walking on the
brink of a precipice; the earth is eaten away beneath
us, and any moment the whole thing may topple
through. Why, it was only yesterday&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What happened yesterday?" I asked.</p>

<p>"A man came, a Mr. Pattens."</p>

<p>"What has Mr. Pattens to do with us?" I said.</p>

<p>"You listen to me, my dear; things are so grave
that I can scarcely smile, and you are so ignorant,
Westenra."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "do tell me about Mr. Pattens."</p>

<p>"He is the butcher, dear, and we owe him over a
hundred pounds, and he is positively desperate. He
asked to see me, and of course I saw him, and then
he said he <i>must</i> see your mother."</p>

<p>"See mother? But mother never sees the tradespeople."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p>"I know, love; but it was with the utmost difficulty
I could keep him from not seeing her. He
said that she was responsible for his account, and
that if I would not let him see her he would do the
other thing."</p>

<p>"What?" I asked, "what?"</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, it is coming, and you may as
well bear it. There will be a bailiff in this house in
no time. Yes, there'll be a man in possession, and
how is your mother to stand that? You think
whether you would rather just tell your grand friend
the Duchess, and save your mother from the depths
of humiliation, or whether you will let things take
their course. Pattens is desperate, and he is the
sort of man who will have no mercy. I have had
to get the meat from another butcher&mdash;we can't
hold out much longer. I have paid away the last
shilling of the reserve fund I had in the bank. Oh
dear, oh dear! why did Mr. Randolph go away? If
he has gone down in the <i>Star of Hope</i>, why truly it
is black night for us."</p>

<p>"I will do my best, Jane, and do keep up heart;
and oh, Jane, keep mother in her room, she must
not know, she must not meet this terrible danger.
O Jane! do your best."</p>

<p>"I will, love. Even at the very worst day dawns
but it is black night at present, that it is," said the
faithful creature.</p>

<p>As I was going out who did I see standing on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
threshold but Mrs. Fanning. Mrs. Fanning had
been away for over a fortnight, and I must say we
greatly enjoyed her absence, and I in particular
enjoyed it; but when I saw her comely, good-humoured,
beaming face now, it seemed to me that
my heart went out to her. She looked at me, and
then she opened her arms wide.</p>

<p>"Come to me, you dear little soul," she said;
"come and have a hearty hug." She clasped me
tightly, and kissed me over and over again.</p>

<p>"I am only back an hour," she said. "And how
is Albert?"</p>

<p>"I have not seen Mr. Fanning this morning," I
answered, and I tried to disengage myself from those
cheery arms.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear, you don't look at all the thing," she
said; "there's the brougham outside, would not you
like a drive, honey? You and I might go out by
ourselves. Come, dearie."</p>

<p>"No, thank you," I answered, "I am going on
some special business for mother."</p>

<p>"Then whatever it is, can't you make use of the
brougham? It was all built and painted to suit
your style, love, and why should not you make use
of it? Albert would be that proud."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed he would not, Mrs. Fanning; but
please do not speak of it, I cannot, I really cannot."</p>

<p>"Well, if you won't, you won't," said the good
woman. "I have come back, though, and I hope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
to see a good deal of you; I have got lots to tell
you. I have been collecting early reminiscences."</p>

<p>"Of what?" I could not help asking.</p>

<p>"Of Albert's babyhood and childhood, they are
that touching. I found a little diary he used to
keep. I declare I laughed and I cried over it.
We'll read it together this evening. Now then, off
you go, and do get some colour back into your pale
cheeks; you are quite the prettiest, most graceful,
most h'aristocratic young lady I ever saw; but you
are too pale now, you really are."</p>

<p>I did not say any more; I grasped Mrs. Fanning's
hand.</p>

<p>"How is your dear mother?" she said.</p>

<p>"Mother is not at all well."</p>

<p>"Ah, poor dear, poor dear," said Mrs. Fanning;
"then no wonder your cheeks are pale. I said to
Albert the very last night I left, 'Albert, if you win
her, she's worth her weight in gold, it is a gold heart
she has; you watch her with her mother, Albert,
and think what she'll be to you.'"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Fanning, you really must not talk in that
way," I said. "Please let me go."</p>

<p>She did let me go. My contact with her had
slightly braced me. I felt angry once more with
the terrible Albert; but Mrs. Fanning was kindness
itself. Oh, if only Albert had been a different man,
and I had really cared for him, and I&mdash;but why
think of the impossible.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span></p>

<p>I got into an omnibus, and gave the man directions
to put me down at the nearest point to the
Duchess's house. I found myself echoing Jane
Mullins's words, "Why had Jim Randolph gone
away?"</p>

<p>I arrived at the Duchess's in good time. I had
made up my mind to tell her all. She must lend
us a thousand pounds. Mother must be saved;
mother must be kept in the dark as to the utter
ruin of my mad plan. I whispered the story as I
would tell it to my old friend over and over to
myself, and when I mounted the steps of the house
and rang the bell I was trembling, and felt very
faint and tired. The footman opened the door, and
I inquired for her Grace.</p>

<p>"Can I see her?" I said. "I am Miss Wickham;
I want to see her on very special business."</p>

<p>"I will mention that you have called, madam,"
replied the man; "but her Grace is not visible, she
is very ill. She has been in bed for several days,
and the doctor is with her. It is influenza."</p>

<p>Then, indeed, I felt my last hopes tottering.</p>

<p>"I am sorry her Grace is ill," I said. I paused for
a moment to consider. "Can I see Miss Mitford?"
I inquired then. Miss Mitford was a lady who did
some correspondence for the Duchess, and who was
generally to be found in the house.</p>

<p>Miss Mitford came downstairs immediately, and I
saw her in a small room to the left of the great hall.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span></p>

<p>"It is the shock about Mr. Randolph," she said
at once.</p>

<p>"Then is it really supposed that he was drowned
in the <i>Star of Hope</i>?" I cried.</p>

<p>"He mentioned that he was coming to England
by that boat," replied Miss Mitford. "The Duchess
is certain that he is amongst the passengers, although
his name has not been mentioned as yet in any
list. Her Grace is terribly upset, more particularly
as Mr. Severn, Sir Henry Severn's only son, died
a fortnight ago. There is great confusion, and Mr.
Randolph ought to be back."</p>

<p>I did not ask any questions with regard to this
latter news, nor did it interest me in the very least.
Of course Mr. Randolph ought to be back, but for
very very different reasons. I went sorrowfully, oh
so sorrowfully, away.</p>

<p>When I returned home Jane was waiting for me
in the hall. She was hovering about, looking very
untidy and very anxious.</p>

<p>"Well," she said; "come in here, I must speak
to you."</p>

<p>"But it is luncheon time," I said, "and people
will wonder."</p>

<p>"Let them wonder. Did you see her? Did she
promise to lend it? That man has been here again.
He is desperate, and says that if he is not paid in
two days he will put in the bailiff."</p>

<p>"And what will that mean?" I asked.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span></p>

<p>"Ruin&mdash;utter and complete. But tell me, did
you see the Duchess?"</p>

<p>"I did not," I answered; "she is ill in bed; and
oh, Jane, it is the shock about Mr. Randolph which
has caused her illness. The Duchess is quite sure
that he did sail in the <i>Star of Hope</i>. O Jane! what
is to be done?"</p>

<p>"God only knows," answered Jane Mullins; "we
are up a tree, and that's the truth."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="s08">THE MAN IN POSSESSION</span></h2>

<p>I cannot exactly say how the next two days went
by. Even in a crisis, people get more or less accustomed
to the thundercloud overhead, and the feeling
of insecurity below. I still found that I could eat,
I could walk, I could even sleep. I still found that
I could be calm in my mother's presence, and could
say little funny nothings to amuse her; and I sat in
such a position, that she did not see the shadow
growing and growing on my face, and the guests did
not suspect anything. Why should they? They
were enjoying all the good things of my most
miserable failure.</p>

<p>Jane, however, never appeared in the drawing-room
now; she left the entertaining of the visitors
to me. She told me boldly that I must take it on
me; that it was the least I could do, and I did take
it on me, and dressed my best, and talked my best,
and sang songs for our visitors in the evenings when
my own heart was breaking.</p>

<p>Captain and Mrs. Furlong were very kind. They
noticed how, more and more often, mother was absent
from meals, and how the colour was paling from my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
cheeks with anxiety for her. It was truly anxiety
for her, but they did not guess what principally
caused it.</p>

<p>On the evening of the third day I hurried into
the dining-room just before dinner. I quite forgot
what I had gone for. It had been a brilliant May
day, but in the evening a fog had come on&mdash;a heavy
sort of cloud overhead, and there was a feeling of
thunder in the air, and the atmosphere was close. I
remember that the windows of the dining-room were
wide open, and the long table was laid in its usual
dainty, and even sumptuous, manner for dinner.
There were some vases of flowers, and the plate, and
china, the polished glass, the snowy napery, all looked
as tasteful, as fresh, as pretty, as heart could desire.
The guests were accustomed to this sort of table,
and would have been very angry if they had been
asked to sit down at any other.</p>

<p>Emma was hurrying in and out, putting final
touches to the preparations for the great meal. I
thought she looked pale, and very anxious, and just
as I was entering the room she came up to me, and
said in a hurried whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>"If I were you, Miss Westenra, I wouldn't go in."</p>

<p>"Why not?" I asked, "why should not I go into
the dining-room?"</p>

<p>She did not say any more; but as I insisted on
going in, pushed past me almost rudely, at least, I
thought so at the moment, and went away, shutting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
the door after her. Then I discovered the reason
why she had wished me not to go into the room. A
little short man, stout and podgy, in a greasy coat,
and a greasy waistcoat, and a dirty tie, rose as I
entered.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, miss," he said. He was seated in
a chair not far from the window. He had a dirty
newspaper on his lap, and by his side was a glass
which must have contained beer at one time, but
was now empty.</p>

<p>"I'm Scofield," he said, "Josiah Scofield at your
service, miss. May I ask, miss, if you're Miss Wickham?"</p>

<p>"I am," I answered; "what are you doing here?
Does Miss Mullins know you are here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, miss," answered the man in quite a humble,
apologetic tone, "she knows quite well I am here,
and so do Emma, the servant; and so do the other
servants, and the reason why too, miss. It's on
account of Pattens, I'm here, miss; and I've come
to stay, if you please."</p>

<p>"To stay!" I echoed feebly, "to stay, why?"</p>

<p>"You see, miss," continued the man; "this is
how things is. You're the daughter of the lady who
owns this house, and I have heard that you own it
partly yourself; and it's this paper that justifies me,
miss, and I can't go out."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he pulled a long, ugly, foolscap envelope
out of his pocket, and taking a paper from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
it, opened it, and showed it to me. I saw something
about <i>Victoria</i>, and <i>by the grace of God</i>, and some other
words in large, staring print, and then my own name,
and my mother's, and Jane Mullins'; and I thrust it
back again. I could not understand it, and I did
not care to read any further.</p>

<p>"I have heard of men like you," I said slowly;
"but I have never seen one of them before."</p>

<p>The man was gazing at me with his queer, bloodshot
eyes, full of the strangest pity.</p>

<p>"It must be a horrid profession for you," I said
suddenly. I could not help myself; at that moment
I seemed to forget my own trouble in sorrow for the
man who had to do such dirty work. Was my brain
going?</p>

<p>Scofield did not answer my last remark. He put
it aside as too foolish to require a reply.</p>

<p>"A very pretty young lady," I heard him mutter,
"and I'm that sorry for her." He looked me all over.</p>

<p>"Now, miss," he said, "there are two ways of
taking a man of my sort."</p>

<p>I nodded my head.</p>

<p>"There's the way of succumbing like, and going
into hysterics, and making no end of a scene, and
the man stays on all the same, and the neighbours
get wind of it, and the ruin's complete in no time, so
to speak. 'Taint nothing much of a bill that's owed
to Pattens, and even if half of it was to be paid, I
have not the slightest doubt that Pattens would take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
me out and give you a bit more time; but there's no
use in quarrelling with me, nor telling me to go, for
go I won't, and can't. I had my orders, and I'm the
man in possession. You have got to face that fact,
miss."</p>

<p>"But you spoke of two ways," I said. "What is
the way which is not&mdash;not quite so hopeless?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the man, rubbing his hands, "now,
we are coming to our senses, we are. Now I can
manage matters fine."</p>

<p>I glanced at the clock. It was already seven
o'clock, and we dined at half-past. The air outside
seemed to grow heavier and heavier, and the sky to
grow darker, and I expected the thunder to roll, and
the lightning to flash at any moment: but what did
external things matter. There was a storm in my
heart which kept out the sound, and the meaning of
external storms.</p>

<p>"Mother! mother!" I kept murmuring under
my breath, "this will kill you, mother. O Mother!
and it has been my fault. My wild, wild scheme has
come to this!"</p>

<p>I felt so ill, that I could scarcely keep upright,
and yet I could not sit in the presence of that man.
The next moment everything in the room seemed to
go round, and I was obliged to totter towards a chair.
I think I lost consciousness, for when I came to myself,
I found the little dirty greasy man had brought
me a glass of water, and was standing near.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span></p>

<p>"You pluck up heart, child," he said, "there now,
you're better. This is not the first nor the second
time I have been in a house as big as this, and just
as grand and full of visitors, and everything seemingly
as right as possible, and the house undermined.
I've seen scores of times like this, and pretty misses,
like you, cut to the heart. It's a nasty trade is
mine, but we all must live, my dear, and I'm truly
sorry for you, and now, if you'll just let me advise
you?"</p>

<p>"What?" I asked, "what?"</p>

<p>"You don't want the guests to know as I'm here?"</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>"I must stay, and the servants had better know
as little about me as possible. Of course, they have
seen me already, but anyhow it is a sort of disguise
that is commonly managed, and I had better do it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I cried.</p>

<p>"My son, Robert, will be round directly. He
often comes to me when I am in possession; I expect
by the same token that's his ring I hear now.
If you'll give me five shillings, miss, I'll do just what
you want, and nobody need guess."</p>

<p>"But what? what?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Bob is bringing me my servant's livery, miss, and
I'll attend at table to-night as your new man-servant.
I look extremely well in livery, and I have often
attended in the houses of gentry just as grand as
yourself. Have you got five shillings in your pocket,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
miss? I have to earn my bread, and I can't do it
for less. Nobody will guess who I am, and why I
am here, if you'll give me that five shillings."</p>

<p>"Take it, take it," I cried. I thrust two half-crowns
into his palm, and fled from the room. In
the hall I found that I had run almost into the arms
of Mr. Fanning.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Wickham," he cried. He caught my
hand to keep me from falling; "why, my dear, what
is the matter?" he said then; there was a world of
affection and sympathy in his voice, but I hated him
for speaking to me thus.</p>

<p>"I have been feeling ill," I said, "I cannot go
down to dinner."</p>

<p>"But what is wrong?" he said. He backed towards
the dining-room door, and I did not want him
to go in. He was so sharp; he would know at once
what that little greasy man meant. I knew by his
manner, and by hints that his mother had dropped,
that they were both of them by no means in the
dark with regard to our affairs. He must not go
into the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Don't go in; come upstairs with me," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, that I will, with pleasure," he answered,
delighted at my tone, "and if you are really ill we
must get the doctor. We cannot allow you to be
really ill, you know, that would never do. I am
very fond of nice girls like you; but they must keep
their health, oh yes, they must. Now you are better,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
that is right. It's this horrid air, and the storm
coming on. You want the country. It's wonderfully
fresh at Highgate; splendid air; so bracing.
I have been out at my place this afternoon, and I
cannot tell you what a difference there is. It is like
another climate."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you stay in your place?" I could
not help answering. "What is it for, if you do not
live there?"</p>

<p>"I won't live in it, Miss Wickham, until I bring
my wife there to bear me company. But now if
you are ill, do go to your room and rest; only come
down to dinner, pray. I never could do with hysterical
girls; but run upstairs and rest, there's a good
child."</p>

<p>I left him, went to my attic, shut and locked the
door, and threw myself on the ground. O God! the
misery of that hour, the bitter blackness of it. But
I must not give way; I must appear at dinner.
Whatever happened I must not give way.</p>

<p>I got up, arranged my hair, washed my face and
hands, dressed myself in the first evening dress I
came across, and went downstairs. The beautiful
little silver gong sounded, and we all trooped down
to the dining-room. There were pleased smiles
among the guests. The room was crowded. Every
seat at the long table had its occupant. Several
fresh paying guests had arrived, and there was the
little man in livery helping Emma to wait. How
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
pleased the old paying guests were to see him. The
new paying guests took him as a matter of course.
Mrs. Armstrong, in particular, nodded to Miss Armstrong,
and bent across to Mr. Fanning and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am so pleased to see that poor Emma is getting
a little help at last." And Mr. Fanning looked at
me and gave me a broad, perceptible wink. I almost
felt as if I must go under the table, but I kept up
my courage as people do sometimes when they are
at the stake, for truly it was like that to me. But
mother was there, looking so sweet and fragile, and
a little puzzled by the new waiter's appearance.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" I heard her say to him
as he brought her some vegetables, and he replied in
a smug, comfortable voice, "Robert, ma'am." And
then she asked him to do one or two things, just as
she would have asked our dear little page in the old
days which had receded, oh! so far, into the background
of my life.</p>

<p>That evening, in the drawing-room, Mrs. Fanning
came up to me.</p>

<p>"They are all talking about Robert," she said.</p>

<p>She sat down, shading me by her own portly
figure from the gaze of any more curious people.</p>

<p>"You shan't sing to-night," she said; "you're not
fit for it, and I for one won't allow it. I told Albert
I'd look after you. We'll have to make excuses
to-morrow when <i>he's</i> not here."</p>

<p>"When who is not here?" I asked.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span></p>

<p>"The man they call Robert, who waited at dinner
to-night."</p>

<p>"But he'll be here to-morrow," I said; "you know
he will; you know it, don't you?"</p>

<p>She bent a little closer, and took my hand.</p>

<p>"Ah, dearie, my dearie," she said. "I have been
low down once. It was before Albert the first made
his fortune. I have been through tight times, and I
know all about it. There, my dearie, take heart,
don't you be fretting; but he won't be here to-morrow,
my love."</p>

<p>"But he will," I said.</p>

<p>"He won't, darling. I know what I'm talking
about. We must make excuses when he goes. We
must say that he wasn't <i>exactly</i> the sort of servant
Jane Mullins wanted, and that she is looking out
for a smarter sort of man. Don't you fret yourself
over it, my darling."</p>

<p>"Oh! I feel very sick and very tired," I cried.
"Mrs. Fanning, will you make some excuse for me
to mother? I must go upstairs and lie down."</p>

<p>"I'll have a talk with your mother, and I'll not
let out a thing to her," said Mrs. Fanning, "and I'll
take you up and put you right into bed myself. I
declare you do want a little bit of mothering from a
woman who has got abundant strength. Your own
poor, dear mother would do it if she could, but she
hasn't got the strength of a fly. I am very strong,
dear, owing to Dr. Williams' Pink Pills, bless the man!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>

<p>Just at that moment Mr. Fanning came up.</p>

<p>He bent his tall, awkward figure towards his
mother, and I distinctly heard the odious word
"Robert," and then Mrs. Fanning took my hand
and led me out of the drawing-room. She was very
kind, and she helped me to get into bed, and when
I was in bed she took my hand and said she was not
going to stir until I fell asleep.</p>

<p>"For I have been through these times, my dear,
but the first time is the worst of all," said the good
woman, and she held my hand tightly, and in spite
of myself her presence comforted me and I did drop
asleep.</p>

<p>The next morning when I went down to breakfast
I could not see any sign of Robert. Immediately
afterwards I went into Jane's room.</p>

<p>"Where is the man in possession?" I said bitterly.</p>

<p>Jane's face looked a little relieved.</p>

<p>"Haven't you heard?" she said; "he has gone.
It was Mr. Fanning who did it. He paid the bill
in full, and the man has gone. He went last
night. Mr. Fanning is arranging the whole thing,
and the man in possession won't come back, that
is, for the present. I begin to see daylight. I am
glad you have made up your mind to be sensible,
Westenra."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<span class="s08">ALBERT</span></h2>

<p>I was so stunned I could not speak at all for a
minute, then I said, after a brief pause&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you know if Mr. Fanning is in?"</p>

<p>"No, why should he be in?" replied Miss Mullins
in an almost irritable voice, "he has got his work to
do if you have not. Men who are generous on the
large scale on which he is generous, cannot afford to
be idle&mdash;that is, if they are going on adding to their
fortunes. He is out and probably in the city, he is
a great publisher, you know, and extremely successful.
For my part, I respect him; he may be a rough
diamond, but he is a diamond all the same."</p>

<p>Still I did not speak, and I am sure my silence,
and the stunned subdued heavy expression on my
face, vexed Jane more than any amount of words I
might have uttered.</p>

<p>"I will go and see if he has really gone," I said.
"It is sometimes quite late before he starts for the
city, I want to speak to him at once."</p>

<p>"Now, Westenra, if you in this crisis make mischief,"
began Miss Mullins.</p>

<p>"Oh, I won't make mischief," I said, "but I must
speak to Mr. Fanning."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span></p>

<p>I had almost reached the door when she called
me back.</p>

<p>"One moment," she said.</p>

<p>I turned, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Please don't keep me, Jane, I must see Mr.
Fanning before he goes to the city&mdash;I will come
back afterwards."</p>

<p>"If I wasn't almost sure what you are going to
say to Mr. Fanning, I would let you go," said Jane,
"but you ought to know&mdash;your mother was very ill,
worse than I have ever seen her before, last night."</p>

<p>"Mother ill in the night, and you never told me!"
The greater trouble seemed to swallow up the lesser,
and for the time I forgot Mr. Fanning, the man in
possession, and everything in the world except mother
herself.</p>

<p>"She had a sharp attack," continued Jane, "rigors
and extreme weakness. I happened most fortunately
to go into her room about midnight, and found her
in an alarming state. Dr. Anderson was summoned.
She is better, much better, but not up yet."</p>

<p>"But, Jane, why, why did you not wake me?"</p>

<p>"I should, dear, if there had been real danger, but
she quickly recovered. You looked so ill yourself
last night, that I had not the heart to disturb your
sleep. And there is no danger at present, no fresh
danger, that is. Unless something happens to cause
her a sudden shock, she is comparatively well, but
it behoves you, Westenra, to be careful."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span></p>

<p>"And suppose I am not careful," I said, a sudden
defiance coming into my voice.</p>

<p>"In that case&mdash;&mdash;" said Miss Mullins. She did
not finish her sentence. She looked full at me, raised
her hands expressively, and let them fall to her sides.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more full of meaning than her
broken sentence, her action, and the expression of
her face.</p>

<p>"But you could not deliberately do it," she said
slowly, "you could not expose a mother like yours
to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course I could do nothing to injure mother,"
I said, "I will try and be patient; but Jane, Jane,
do you know really what this means? Can you not
guess that there are things that even for a mother,
a dying mother, a girl ought not to do?"</p>

<p>"I do not see that," answered Jane deliberately;
"no, I do not, not from your point of view. You
can do what is required, and you can bear it."</p>

<p>I knew quite well what she meant. She did not
call me back this time when I left the room. I
heard her mutter to herself&mdash;her words startled me&mdash;putting
a new sort of sudden light on all our
miserable affairs.</p>

<p>"My little home gone too," I heard her mutter,
"ruin for me too, for me too."</p>

<p>I stood for a moment in the dark passage outside
Jane's room. There was no one there, and I could
think. I did not want to go into the big hall, nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
to run up the staircase. I might meet some of those
smiling, well satisfied, delighted and delightful paying
guests, those paying guests who were ruining us all
the time. Yes, I knew at last what Jane meant,
what Mrs. Fanning meant, what Albert Fanning
meant. We would be relieved from our embarrassments,
mother would receive no shock <i>if I promised
to marry Albert Fanning</i>. Albert Fanning would save
the position, he would pay the necessary debts; he
was rich, and for love of me he would not mind
what he did. Yes, I supposed it was love for me.
I did not know, of course. I could not fancy for a
moment that a girl like myself could excite any
feeling of worship in a man like Albert Fanning, but
anyhow, for whatever reason, he wanted me (and he
did want me), he was willing to pay this big price
for me. My heart trembled, my spirit quaked. I
stood in the luxury of the dark passage, clasped my
hands to my brow, and then determined not to give
way, to be brave to the very end.</p>

<p>I ran upstairs and entered the drawing-room. It
was tidy, in perfect order. I was glad to find no one
there. I went and stood under father's picture. I
gazed full up at the resolute, brave, handsome face.</p>

<p>"You died to win your V.C.," I said to myself,
and then I turned to leave the room. I met Mrs.
Furlong coming in.</p>

<p>"Ah, dear child," she said, "I am so glad to see
you. But what is the matter? You don't look well."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span></p>

<p>"I am anxious," I answered; "mother had a very
serious attack last night."</p>

<p>"We are all full of concern about her," replied
Mrs. Furlong. "Won't you sit down for a moment?
I wish to talk to you. Ah, here comes my husband.
Philip, we have bad news about dear Mrs. Wickham,
she was very ill last night."</p>

<p>"Your mother, Miss Wickham, is very far from
strong," said Captain Furlong. He came and stood
near me; he looked full of sympathy. He was very
nice and kind and gentlemanly. He had been kind
and courteous, and unselfish, ever since he came to
the house.</p>

<p>"You are very good, both of you," I said. "I am
going to mother now; please, don't keep me."</p>

<p>"But is there anything we can do? Would change
be of service to her?" said Mrs. Furlong. "I know
it is a little early in the year, but the spring is
coming on nicely, and she must weary so of London,
particularly this part of London; she has been accustomed
to such a different life."</p>

<p>"I do not think our present life has injured her,"
I said. "She has not had any of the roughing.
Things have been made smooth and pleasant and
bright for her."</p>

<p>"All the same, it has been a very, very great
change for her," said Mrs. Furlong. "It has been
good neither for her nor for you. Yes, Philip," she
continued, noticing a warning expression on her husband's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
face, "I have got my opportunity, and I will
speak out. I am quite certain the sooner Westenra
Wickham, and her dear mother, leave this boarding-house
the better it will be for both of them. What
has a young, innocent girl, like Westenra, to do with
paying guests? Oh, if they were all like you and me,
dear, it would be different; but they are not all like
us, and there's that"&mdash;she dropped her voice. Captain
Furlong shook his head.</p>

<p>"Miss Wickham has accepted the position, and I
do not see how she can desert her post," he said.</p>

<p>"Never fear, be sure I will not," I answered; "but
please&mdash;please, kind friends, don't keep me now."</p>

<p>"There is just one thing I should like to say
before you go, Miss Wickham," said Captain Furlong;
"if you find yourself in trouble of any sort
whatever, pray command both my wife and myself.
I have seen a good deal of life in my day. My wife
and I are much interested, both in you and your
mother. Now, for instance," he added, dropping his
voice, "I know about tight times; we all of us get
more or less into a tight corner, now and then&mdash;if a
fifty pound note would&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no, it would not do anything," I cried. My
face was crimson; my heart seemed cut in two.</p>

<p>"Oh! how can I thank you enough?" I added;
and I ran up to the kind man and seized his hands.
I could almost have kissed them in my pain and
gratitude. "It would be useless, quite useless, but
I shall never forget your kindness."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span></p>

<p>I saw the good-natured pair look at one another,
and Mrs. Furlong shook her head wisely; and I am
sure a dewy moisture came to her eyes, but I did not
wait to say anything more, but ran off in the direction
of mother's room. A softened light filled that
chamber, where all that refinement and love could
give surrounded the most treasured possession of my
life. Mother was lying in bed propped up by pillows.
She looked quite as well as usual, and almost sweeter
than I had ever seen her look, and she smiled when
I came in.</p>

<p>"Well, little girl," she said, "you are late in paying
me your visit this morning?"</p>

<p>"It was very wrong of you, mother, not to send
for me when you were so ill last night," I answered.</p>

<p>"Oh, that time," said mother, "it seems ages off
already, and I am quite as well as usual. I have
got a kind nurse to look after me now. Nurse
Marion, come here."</p>

<p>I could not help giving a visible start. Were
things so bad with mother that she required the
services of a trained nurse? A comely, sweet-faced,
young woman of about thirty years of age, now approached
from her seat behind the curtain.</p>

<p>"The doctor sent me in, Miss Wickham; he
thought your mother would be the better for constant
care for two or three days."</p>

<p>"I am very glad you have come," I answered.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is so nice," said mother; "Nurse Marion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
has made me delightfully comfortable; and is not the
room sweet with that delicious old-fashioned lavender
she uses, and with all those spring flowers?"</p>

<p>"I have opened the window, too," said the nurse,
"the more air the dear lady gets the better for her;
but now, Miss Wickham, I cannot allow your mother
to talk. Will you come back again; or, if you stay,
will you be very quiet?"</p>

<p>"As you are here to look after mother I will come
back again," I said. I bent down, kissed the lily
white hand which lay on the counterpane, and rushed
from the room. Stabs of agony were going through
my heart, and yet I must not give way!</p>

<p>I ran upstairs, and knocked at Mrs. Fanning's
door. As Albert Fanning was out, I was determined
to see her. There was no reply to my summons,
and after a moment I opened the door and looked
in. The room was empty. I went to my own room,
sat down for a moment, and tried to consider how
things were tending with me, and what the end
would be. Rather than mother should suffer another
pang, I would marry Albert Fanning. But
must it come to this!</p>

<p>I put on my outdoor things, and ran downstairs.
The closeness and oppression of the day before had
changed into a most balmy and delicious spring morning;
a sort of foretaste day of early summer. I was
reckless, my purse was very light, but what did that
matter. I stopped a hansom, got into it, and gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
the man Albert Fanning's address in Paternoster
Row. Was I mad to go to him&mdash;to beard the lion
in his den? I did not know; I only knew that sane or
mad, I must do what I had made up my mind to do.</p>

<p>The hansom bowled smoothly along, and I sat
back in the farthest corner, and tried to hope that
no one saw me. A pale, very slender, very miserable
girl was all that they would have seen; the grace
gone from her, the beauty all departed; a sort of
wreck of a girl, who had made a great failure of her
life, and of the happiness of those belonging to her.
Oh, if only the past six or eight months could be
lived over again, how differently would I have spent
them! The cottage in the country seemed now to
be a sort of paradise. If only I could take mother
to it, I would be content to be buried away from the
eyes of the world for evermore. But mother was
dying; there would be no need soon for any of us
to trouble about her future, for God Himself was
taking it into His own hands, and had prepared for
her a mansion, and an unfading habitation.</p>

<p>I scarcely dared think of this. Be the end long,
or be the end short, during the remaining days or
weeks of her existence, she must not be worried, she
must go happily, securely, confidently, down to the
Valley. That was the thought, the only thought
which stayed with me, as I drove as fast as I could
in the direction of Mr. Fanning's place of business.</p>

<p>The cab was not allowed to go up the Row, so I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
paid my fare at the entrance, and then walked to my
destination. I knew the number well, for Albert
had mentioned it two or three times in my hearing,
having indeed often urged me to go and see him. I
stopped therefore at the right place, looked up, saw
the name of Albert Fanning in huge letters across
the window, opened the door and entered. I found
myself in a big, book saloon, and going up to a man
asked if Mr. Fanning were in. The man was one of
those smart sort of clerks, who generally know everybody's
business but their own. He looked me all over
in a somewhat quizzical way, and then said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you an appointment, miss?"</p>

<p>"I have not," I replied.</p>

<p>"Our chief, Mr. Fanning, never sees ladies without
appointments."</p>

<p>"I think he will see me," I answered, "he happens
to know me. Please say that Miss Westenra Wickham
has called to see him."</p>

<p>The clerk stared at me for a moment.</p>

<p>"Miss West! what Wickham Miss? Perhaps you
wouldn't mind writing it down."</p>

<p>I did not want to write down my name, but I did
so; I gave it to the clerk, who withdrew, smiling to
a brother clerk as he did so. He came back in a
minute or two, looking rather red about the face,
and went back to his seat without approaching me,
and at the same time I heard heavy, ungainly steps
rushing downstairs, and Mr. Fanning, in his office
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
coat, which was decidedly shabby, and almost as
greasy as the one which belonged to the "Man in
Possession" on the previous evening, entered the
saloon. His hair stood wildly up on his head, and
his blue eyes were full of excitement. He came
straight up to me.</p>

<p>"I say, this is a pleasure," he exclaimed, "and
quite unlooked for. Pray, come upstairs at once,
Miss Wickham. I am delighted to see you&mdash;delighted.
Understand, Parkins," he said, addressing
the clerk who had brought my message, "that I am
engaged for the present, absolutely engaged, and can
see <i>no one</i>. Now, Miss Wickham, now."</p>

<p>He ushered me as if I were a queen through the
saloon, past the wondering and almost tittering clerks,
and up some winding stairs to his own sanctum on
the first floor.</p>

<p>"Cosy, eh?" he said, as he opened the door, and
showed me a big apartment crowded with books
of every shape and size, and heavily, and at the
same time, handsomely furnished. "Not bad for
a city man's office, eh?" he continued, "all the
books are amusing; you might like to dip into 'em
by-and-by, nothing deep or dull, or stodgy here,
all light, frothy, and merry. Nothing improving,
all entertaining. That is how my father made
his fortune; and that is how I, Albert the second,
as the mater calls me, intend to go on adding to my
fortune. It is on light, frothy, palatable morsels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
that I and my wife will live in the future, eh, eh?
You're pleased with the look of the place, ain't you.
Now then, sit right down here facing the light, so that
I can have a good view of you. You're so young;
you have not a wrinkle on you. It's the first sign
of age coming on when a girl wishes to sit with her
back to the light, but you are young, and you can
stand the full glare. Here, you take the office chair.
Isn't it comfortable? That's where I have sat for
hours and hours, and days and days; and where my
father sat before me. How well you'd look interviewing
authors and artists when they come here
with their manuscripts. But there! I expect you'd
be a great deal too kind to them. A lot of rubbish
you would buy for the firm of Fanning &amp; Co., wouldn't
you now, eh? Ah, it's you that has got a tender
little heart, and Albert Fanning has been one of
the first to find it out."</p>

<p>I could not interrupt this rapid flow of words,
and sat in the chair indicated, feeling almost stunned.
At last he stopped, and gazing at me, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, and how <i>is</i> Miss Westenra Wickham, and
what has brought her to visit her humble servant?
Out with it now, the truth, please."</p>

<p>Still I could find no words. At last, however, I
said almost shyly&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have been kind, more than kind, but I
came here to tell you, you must not do it."</p>

<p>"Now that's a pretty sort of thing to bring you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
here," said Mr. Fanning. "Upon my soul, that's a
queer errand. I have been kind, forsooth! and I
am not to be kind in the future. And pray why
should I turn into an evil, cruel sort of man at your
suggestion, Miss Wickham? Why should I, eh?
Am I to spoil my fine character because you, a little
slip of a girl, wish it so?"</p>

<p>"You must listen to me," I said; "you do not
take me seriously, but you must. This is no laughing
matter."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am to talk sense, am I? What a little
chit it is! but it is a dear little thing in its way,
although saucy. It's trying to come round me and
to teach me. Well, well, I don't mind owning that
you can turn me with a twist of your little finger
wherever you please. You have the most bewitching
way with you I ever saw with any girl. It has
bowled Albert Fanning over, that it has. Now, then,
what have you really come for?"</p>

<p>"You paid the bill of Pattens the butcher either
this morning or last night, why did you do it?"</p>

<p>Mr. Fanning had the grace to turn red when I
said this. He gave me even for a moment an uncomfortable
glance, then said loudly&mdash;</p>

<p>"But you didn't surely want that fellow Robert
to stay on?"</p>

<p>"That is quite true," I replied, "but I still less
want you, Mr. Fanning, to pay our debts. You did
very wrong to take such a liberty without my permission,
very, very wrong."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span></p>

<p>"To tell you the honest truth, I never wished you
to know about it," said Mr. Fanning. "Who blurted
it out?"</p>

<p>"Jane Mullins, of course, told me."</p>

<p>"Ah, I mentioned to the mater that it would be
very silly to confide in that woman, and now the
little mater has done no end of mischief. She has
set your back up and&mdash;but there, you were bound
to know of it sooner or later. Of course the butcher's
is not the only bill I must pay, and you were bound
to know, of course. I don't really mind that you do
know. It's a great relief to you, ain't it now?"</p>

<p>"It is not a great relief, and what is more I cannot
allow it."</p>

<p>"You cannot allow it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Mr. Fanning now pulled his chair up so close to
mine that his knees nearly touched me. I drew back.</p>

<p>"You needn't be afraid that I'll come closer," he
said almost sulkily, "you know quite well what I
feel about you, Miss Wickham, for I have said it
already. I may have a few more words to deliver on
that point by-and-by, but now what I want to say is
this, that I won't force any one to come to me except
with a free heart. Nobody, not even you&mdash;not even
<i>you</i>&mdash;although, God knows, you are like no one
else on earth, shall come to me except willingly. I
never met any one like you before, so dainty, so fair
so pretty&mdash;oh, so very pretty, and such a sweet girl
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
and, upon my word, you can make just anything
of me. But there, the time for love-making has
not yet come, and you have something ugly to say
in the back of your head, I see the thought shining
out of your eyes. Oh, however hard you may feel,
and however much pain you mean to give me, you
cannot make those eyes of yours look ugly and forbidding.
Now I am prepared to listen."</p>

<p>He folded his arms across his chest and looked
full at me. He was in such great and desperate
earnest that he was not quite so repellant as usual.
I could not but respect him, and I found it no longer
difficult to speak freely to him.</p>

<p>"I come as a woman to appeal to a man," I said.
"You are a man and I am a woman, we stand on
equal ground. You would not like your sister, had
you a sister, to do what you want me to do. I
appeal to you on behalf of that sister who does not
exist."</p>

<p>He tried to give a laugh, but it would not rise to
his lips.</p>

<p>"As you justly remarked," he said, "I have not
got a sister."</p>

<p>"But you know, you must know, Mr. Fanning,
what you would feel if you had a sister, and she
allowed a man who was no relation, no relation
whatever, to take her debts and pay them. What
would you think of your sister?"</p>

<p>"I'd say the sooner she and that chap married
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
the better," was Mr. Fanning's blunt response;
"they'd be relations then fast enough, eh, eh? I
think I have about answered you, Miss Wickham."</p>

<p>"But suppose she did not want to marry that
man; suppose she had told him that she never
would marry him; suppose he knew perfectly well
in his heart that she could not marry him, because
she had not a spark of love to give him?"</p>

<p>"But I don't suppose anything of the sort," said
Mr. Fanning, and now his face grew white, uncomfortably
white, and I saw his lips trembling.</p>

<p>"There now," he said, "you have had your say,
and it is my turn. I see perfectly well what you
are driving at. You think I have taken an unfair
advantage of you, but this was the position. I
knew all about it, I had seen it coming for some
time. Jane Mullins had dropped hints to mother,
and mother had dropped hints to me, and, good
gracious! I could tell for myself. I am a man of
business; I knew exactly what each of the boarders
paid. I knew exactly or nearly to a nicety, and if I
didn't my mother did, what the dinners cost which
we ate night after night in your dining-room, and
what the furniture must have cost, and what the
breakfast cost, and the hundred and one things
which were necessary to keep up an establishment
of that kind, and I said to the mater, 'Look you
here, mater, the incomings are so and so, and the
outgoings are so and so, and a smash is <i>inevitable</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
It will come sooner or later, and it is my opinion it
will come sooner, not later.' The mater agreed with
me, for she is shrewd enough, and we both thought
a great deal of you, and a great deal of your mother.
We knew that although you were dainty in your
ways, and belonged to a higher social class than we
did (we are never going, either of us, to deny that),
we knew that you were ignorant of these things, and
had not our wisdom, and we thought Jane Mullins
was a bit of a goose to have launched in such a
hopeless undertaking. But, of course, as the mater
said, she said it many, many times, 'There may be
money at the back of this thing, Albert, and if there
is they may pull through.' But when Mr. Randolph
went off in that fine hurry last winter, we found out
all too quickly that there was no money at the back,
and then, of course, the result was inevitable.</p>

<p>"I expected Pattens to send a man in, for I had
met him once or twice, and he told me that his bill
was not paid, and that he did not mean to supply
any more meat, and what Pattens said the baker
and greengrocer said too, and so did Allthorp the
grocer, and so did the fishmonger, Merriman, and so
did all the other tradespeople, and if one spoke to
me, so did they all. I have paid Pattens, but that
is not enough. Pattens won't trouble you any more,
his man has gone, but there is Merriman's man to
come on, and there is Allthorp's man, and there are
all the others, and then, above and beyond all, there's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
the landlord, Mr. Hardcastle. Why, the March
quarter's rent has not been paid yet, and that is a
pretty big sum. So, my dear young lady, things
<i>cannot</i> go on, and what is to be done? Now there's
the question&mdash;what is to be done?"</p>

<p>I stared at him with frightened eyes. It was
perfectly true that I knew nothing whatever about
business. I had imagined myself business-like,
and full of common sense, but I found in this
extreme moment that my business qualities were
nowhere, and that this hard-headed and yet honest
man of the world was facing the position for me, and
seeing things as I ought to see them.</p>

<p>"What is to be done?" he repeated. "Are you
going to have the bed on which your mother sleeps
sold under her, and she dying, or are you not? I
can help you, I have plenty of money, I have a lot
of loose cash in the bank which may as well go in
your direction as any other. Shall I spend it for
you, or shall I not?"</p>

<p>"But if you do&mdash;if you do," I faltered, "what
does it mean?"</p>

<p>"Mean!" he said, and now a queer light came
into his eyes, and he drew nearer again, and bending
forward tried to take my hand. I put it hastily
behind me.</p>

<p>"I'll be frank," he said, "I'll be plain, <i>it means you</i>."</p>

<p>"I cannot, oh! I cannot," I said. I covered my
face with both my hands; I was trembling all over.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span></p>

<p>"Give me your promise," he said, dropping his
voice very low, "just give me your promise. I'll
not hurry you a bit. Give me your promise that in
the future, say in a year (I'll give you a whole year,
yes I will, although it goes hard with me)&mdash;say in a
year, you will be mine, you'll come to me as my little
wife, and I won't bother you, upon my soul I won't,
before the time. I'll go away from 17 Graham
Square, I will, yes I will. The mater can stay, she
likes looking after people, and she is downright
fond of you, but I won't worry you. Say you'll be
my little wife, and you need not have another care.
The bills shall be paid, and we'll close the place
gradually. The boarding-house, on its present terms,
cannot go on, but we will close up gradually, and
poor old Miss Mullins need not be a pauper for the
rest of her days. She's a right down good sort, and
I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll start her in a little
boarding-house of a humble kind on my own hook.
Yes, I will, and she shall make a tidy fortune out
of it. I'll do all that, and for you, for <i>you</i>, and you
have only got to promise."</p>

<p>"But I cannot," I said, and now I began to sob.
"Oh, I cannot. You don't want a wife who doesn't
love you at all."</p>

<p>"Not even a little bit?" he said, and there was a
pathetic ring in his voice. "Aren't you sure that
you love me just a very little bit? Well, well, you
will some day; you will when you know me better.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
I am a very rough sort of diamond, Miss Wickham,
but I am a diamond all the same, if being true and
honourable and honest and straightforward means
anything at all. I don't want to speak too well of
myself, but I do know that in my entire life I have
never done a real mean or shabby thing. I am an
honest fellow out and out, Miss Wickham, and I
offer you all I have, and I will get you out of this
scrape in a twinkling, that I will. You thought,
perhaps, your fine friend Mr. Randolph would do it,
but when he guessed how things were going he cut
off fast enough to the other side of the world."</p>

<p>"I won't let you speak of him like that," I cried,
and my voice rose again with anger, and the pity I
had felt for Mr. Fanning a moment ago vanished as
if it had never existed. "Mr. Randolph has been
our true, true friend, and he may be dead now. Oh,
you are cruel to speak of him like that!"</p>

<p>"Very well, we won't talk of him. It is unkind
to abuse the dead," said Mr. Fanning in a low, considerate
sort of voice. "He sailed, poor chap, in the
<i>Star of Hope</i>, and the <i>Star of Hope</i> has been wrecked.
He will never come back to bother anybody again,
so we won't talk of him."</p>

<p>I was silent. A cold, faint feeling was stealing
over me.</p>

<p>"Well, now, you listen to me," continued Mr. Fanning.
"You think that it is very hard on you that
a man of my sort should want you to be his wife,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
but men of my sort, when they make fortunes, often
do marry girls like you. I have a lot of money,
Miss Wickham, plenty and plenty, thousands upon
thousands, and it's piling up every day. It is the
froth and the light literature that has done it&mdash;all
those picture-books, coloured, most of 'em, and those
children's books, and those nonsense rhymes, and all
that sort of thing. We have huge sales all over the
world, and the money rolls in for Albert Fanning,
and Albert Fanning can marry about any girl he
chooses. Why shouldn't he take a wife a peg above
him? It's done every day, and why should not his
wife be happy? What is there against that house
at Highgate, for instance, and what is there against
the old woman? Is there an honester or a better
heart than hers?"</p>

<p>"That is quite true; I really love your mother,"
I said.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's a good girl, now." He laid his big
hand on mine and gave it a little pat. "And you'll
be all right when you come to me; you'll be as comfortable
as possible. You'll soon get accustomed to
me and my ways."</p>

<p>"But I can never, never come to you," I cried,
shrinking away. "I cannot make you that promise."</p>

<p>"I won't take your answer now, and I have not
done speaking yet. Do you know that I have cared
for you for a long time? I'll tell you how it happened.
I was in the Park one day, more than two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
years ago. I had been in Germany, learning book-binding.
There was nothing I did not go into as far
as my trade was concerned, and I had come back
again, and I was in the Park watching the fine folks.
My pockets were comfortably lined, and I had not a
debt in the world, and I was feeling pretty spry, you
may be sure, and thinking, 'Albert Fanning, the time
has come for you to take a mate; the time has come
for you and your sweetheart to meet, and to have a
right good time, and a happy life afterwards.' And
I was thinking which of the suburbs I'd live in, and
what sort of girl I'd have. Oh, there were plenty
ready to come to me for the asking, young girls, too,
with rosy cheeks and bright eyes. There was one, I
never saw blacker eyes than hers; they were as
black as sloes, and I always admired black eyes,
because I am fair, you know, and the mater is fair.
You always like your opposite as a rule, and as
these thoughts were coming to me, and I was thinking
of Susan Martin and her black eyes, and the merry
laugh she had, and her white teeth, who should
come driving slowly by, in the midst of all the other
grand folks, but your little self. You were bending
forward, doing something for your mother, putting
a shawl about her or something, and you just gave
the tiniest bit of a smile, and I saw a gleam of your
teeth, and I looked at your grey eyes; and, upon my
word, it was all over with me. I never knew there
were girls like you in existence before. I found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
myself turning at first white and then red, and at
first hot and then cold, and I followed that carriage
as fast as I could, and whenever I had a chance I
took a glance at you. Oh, you were high above me,
far away from me, with people that I could never
have anything to do with; but I lost my heart to
you, and Susan Martin hadn't a chance. I found
out from the mater that you were Miss Wickham,
and that your father had been a general officer in
the army, and you lived in Mayfair, and went into
society; and often and often I went into the Park
to catch a glimpse of you, and I got the number of
your house, and sometimes I passed it by and looked
up at the windows, and once I saw you there; you
were arranging some flowers. I just caught the bend
of your head, and I saw the shape of your throat,
and your straight profile, and the whole look of you,
and my heart went pitter-pat. I wasn't myself after
I had caught a glimpse of you. You filled all my
world, and the old mater found out there was something
wrong. I am reserved about some things, and
I didn't let it out to her, but at last I did, and she
said, 'Courage, Albert, courage. If you want her,
why shouldn't you have her? You have plenty of
money, and you're a right good sort.' And then all
of a sudden one day the mater came to me with
news, no less news than this, that you, you plucky
little darling, were going to start a boarding-house on
your own account. After that, it was plain sailing."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span></p>

<p>"She is poor," said the mother. "She and her
mother have lost all their money; they are down in
the world, down on their luck, and they are going to
do this. So then we arranged that we'd come and
live in the boarding-house, and I began my courting
in hot earnest, and fortune has favoured me, Miss
Wickham; fortune has favoured me, Westenra, and
oh! I love you, God knows how much, and I'd be a
good husband to you, and you should have your own
way in everything. Won't you think of it, Miss
Wickham? Won't you?"</p>

<p>I was silent. The tears were running down my
cheeks, and I had no voice to speak. I got up at
last slowly.</p>

<p>"Won't you think of it?" he said again.</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"Well, I tell you what," he said, turning very pale.
"Don't give me your answer now. Wait until this
evening or to-morrow. I won't worry you in the
drawing-room to-night. I'll keep far away, and I'll
try if I can to keep everybody at bay&mdash;all those
wolves, I mean, that are surrounding you&mdash;and maybe
you'll think better of it, for the position is a very
serious one; maybe you'll think better of it. And
remember, whatever happens, there ain't a fellow on
earth would make you a better husband than I shall,
if you'll let me."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span class="s08">THE BOND</span></h2>

<p>I went slowly home. I walked all the way, I was
glad of the exercise, I wanted to tire my body in
order that my mind should not think too acutely.
When I got in, it was lunch time. I went into the
dining-room without taking off my hat. Jane
Mullins was there, as usual she was at the foot of
the table, she was busy carving, and she was chatting
to Mrs. Armstrong, and Mrs. Armstrong was looking
somewhat mysterious, and when she saw me she
gave me a kindly nod, but I perceived the curiosity
in her eyes and turned my face away.</p>

<p>Marion Armstrong was seldom in to lunch, she
was at her School of Art doing those drawings by
which she hoped to win the hand of Albert Fanning.
But what chance had she of Albert Fanning?</p>

<p>Mrs. Fanning was present, and she looked very
stout and prosperous, and mysterious and happy,
and as I sat down, not far away from her, she
suddenly stretched her fat hand across the table
and grasped mine and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"How are you, dear, and how is your mother?"</p>

<p>I answered that I hoped mother was better, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
Captain and Mrs. Furlong looked at me also with
pity. I had never greater difficulty in keeping my
composure than I had during that awful meal, but
I did eat a cutlet when it was put on my plate, and
I did manage to talk to my neighbour, a new boarder
who had come up from the country, and did not
know her way about anywhere. She was an excitable
middle-aged lady of between forty and fifty,
and she asked questions which I was able to answer,
and helped me more than she knew to get through
that terrible meal.</p>

<p>At last it was over and I went up to mother's
room. To my great astonishment it was empty.
Where was mother? Was she better? What could
have happened? With a mingling of alarm and
anticipation I ran into the drawing-room. She was
there in her old accustomed seat by the window.
She looked very much as usual. When she saw
me she called me over to her.</p>

<p>"Are you surprised, West?" she said.</p>

<p>"I am greatly surprised," I answered; "are you
better, Mummy?" I bent over her, calling her by
the old childish, very childish name. She laid her
thin hand on mine, her hand was hot, but her face
looked, with the colour in her cheeks, and her eyes
so feverishly bright, more beautiful than I had ever
seen it. I sat down near her.</p>

<p>"You don't know how nice Nurse Marion has
been," she said. "When she found I really wished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
to get up, she did not oppose me, and she dressed
me so carefully, and I am not the least bit tired. I
longed to come into the drawing-room, I seem to
have quite got over that attack; you need not be
anxious, West."</p>

<p>"Very well, I won't be anxious," I answered; "I
will sit close to you here and read to you if you will
let me."</p>

<p>"I should love to hear you, darling. Read
Whittier's poem, 'My Psalm.' Some of the lines
have been ringing in my head all day, and I always
like the sort of cadence in your voice when you read
poetry aloud."</p>

<p>I knew Whittier's "Psalm" well, and without
troubling to get the book, I began to repeat the
well-known words&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"I mourn no more my vanished years:</p>
<p class="i1">Beneath a tender rain,</p>
<p>An April rain of smiles and tears,</p>
<p class="i1">My heart is young again.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The west-winds blow, and singing low,</p>
<p class="i1">I hear the glad streams run;</p>
<p>The windows of my soul I throw</p>
<p class="i1">Wide open to the sun.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>No longer forward nor behind,</p>
<p class="i1">I look in hope and fear:</p>
<p>But grateful, take the good I find,</p>
<p class="i1">The best of now and here."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As I slowly repeated the words, I noticed that
mother's gentle soft eyes were fixed on my face.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
She raised her hand now and then as if to beat time
to the rhythm of the poetry. At last I reached the
final verses.</p>

<p>"Say them slowly, West," whispered mother; "I
know them so well, and they have comforted me so
often. Say them very slowly, in particular that verse
which speaks about death as 'but a covered way,'"</p>

<p>I continued&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"That more and more a Providence</p>
<p class="i1">Of Love is understood,</p>
<p>Making the springs of time and sense</p>
<p class="i1">Sweet with eternal good;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>That death seems but a covered way,</p>
<p class="i1">Which opens into light,</p>
<p>Wherein no blinded child can stray</p>
<p class="i1">Beyond the Father's sight;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>That care and trial seem at last,</p>
<p class="i1">Through Memory's sunset air,</p>
<p>Like mountain-ranges overpast</p>
<p class="i1">In purple distance fair;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>That all the jarring notes of life</p>
<p class="i1">Seem blending in a psalm,</p>
<p>And all the angles of its strife</p>
<p class="i1">Slow rounding into calm.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And so the shadows fall apart,</p>
<p class="i1">And so the west-winds play;</p>
<p>And all the windows of my heart</p>
<p class="i1">I open to the day."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"Ah," said mother, when my voice finally ceased,
it had very nearly failed me towards the end, "that
is just how I am. I sit by the open window, I look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
out and beyond, I see no trouble anywhere. The
peace is wonderful, wonderful. It is all my Father's
doing, my heavenly Father's doing. I am so
strangely happy that I cannot quite understand
myself. Last night something strange happened,
West. Your dear father, my beloved husband,
came back to me."</p>

<p>"Mother!" I cried.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said very gently, "he did; you will
understand some day, I cannot explain what happened.
He came to my room. He looked at me
with your eyes, my darling, only older and more
grave; eyes with the weight of the knowledge of life
in them, and the understanding of the Life beyond
in them. He looked at me, and there was both joy
and sorrow in his eyes, and the joy seemed greater
than the sorrow. He even took my hand in his, and
I fancied I heard him say something about our going
away together, but I am not quite sure on that point.
I only know that he was with me, and that now I
feel no pain. Nothing can trouble me again. Even
dying cannot trouble me. West, my child, what are
you crying for?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not crying at all, mother, only, somehow,
there is a pathos in your words, but I am not
crying."</p>

<p>She took my hand and patted it softly.</p>

<p>"You have no cause for tears, as far as I am concerned,"
she said. "I am the happiest woman in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
the world, I have had a happy life, such a husband,
so dear a daughter, and now this wonderful, wonderful
peace, this joy, and there is no death, dear West,
for those who really love; there is no real parting
for those who love."</p>

<p>From where we sat we could see the trees in the
Square garden. They had put on their spring green,
and most lovely was the mantle they wore. The
dust of London had not yet had time to spoil them.
The freshness of their appearance on that May
morning was as vivid, as perfect, as though those
trees lived themselves in the heart of the country;
they seemed to be a little bit of God in the middle
of that town Square. I kept watching them, and
glancing from time to time at mother, but all through
there was in my mind another thought, the thought
of Mr. Fanning and what he wanted me to do.
After all, if the end of life was so full of bliss, what
mattered any cross on the journey. I felt ready
for sacrifice. I rose very slowly, and softly left the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>By a sort of common consent, the boarders had
all gone out on this exquisite early summer's afternoon,
and mother and I had the room to ourselves.
Even Mrs. Fanning had gone out. I crossed the
landing, and went into mother's bedroom. Nurse
Marion was there. I shut the door behind me.</p>

<p>"How long will mother live?" I said abruptly.
I was in the humour not to walk round anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
that day; I wanted to hear the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth.</p>

<p>Nurse Marion looked at me in astonishment.</p>

<p>"You don't look well yourself, Miss Wickham,"
she answered.</p>

<p>"Never mind about me," I replied, "answer my
question. If nothing harms her, if she gets no shock,
how long will my mother live?"</p>

<p>"She may live for months and months," replied
the nurse.</p>

<p>"And if she gets a shock, a sudden shock?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" the woman held up her hands ominously,
"we must keep her from any thing of that sort, even
a very little agitation would be bad for her; but I
never saw a calmer, sweeter lady. She does not
know she is dying, but why should she be troubled,
she is close to God Himself, she lives in a sort of
Paradise."</p>

<p>"Thank you," I answered. The tears were pressing
hard on my eyes, but I would not let them
fall.</p>

<p>"She thinks all the world of you, Miss Wickham,"
continued the nurse. "If she has an anxiety, it is
about you; but even for you I do not think she
feels real fear now. You will forgive me for speaking
so frankly, but I can tell, miss, for I have seen
much sorrow myself, that you are perplexed and
puzzled and miserable just now, but I assure you
you need not be sorry on your mother's account. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
lives in the Land of Beulah. Have you ever read
the 'Pilgrim's Progress'? You know, of course, to
what I allude?"</p>

<p>"I know to what you allude," I answered; "the
Land of Beulah is a beautiful country, but I am
too young to understand about it."</p>

<p>"We are none of us too young to understand
about that," replied the nurse. "I have been with
many people suffering as your mother suffers, but I
never before came across any one quite so gentle, so
resigned, so happy, so peaceful,&mdash;<i>it is the peace of God</i>."</p>

<p>"We must keep her as long as we can," I said;
"she is the most precious thing in all the world; we
must keep her as long as we ever can. She must
not have a shock nor a care."</p>

<p>"Of course not," answered the nurse.</p>

<p>I returned again to the drawing-room, taking
some needlework with me. I sat near mother plying
my needle, weaving a pattern with coloured
silks into my embroidery.</p>

<p>"How lovely the day is!" said mother. She
made little remarks of this sort from time to time,
but she did not do what was her invariable habit,
and the fact of her omitting to do this caused me
some surprise. As a rule, whenever she looked at
any one, she generally ended by glancing at father's
picture, but to-day she did not once look at it.
This impressed me as so very strange and so unlike
her, that I said&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span></p>

<p>"Can't you see the picture from where you sit?"
We always called it <i>the</i> picture; it was the one
picture for us both.</p>

<p>"I can see it perfectly if I want to," she answered,
"but I do not care to look at it to-day. I see his
own face wherever I turn, that is much more lifelike,
and more interesting, and has more varied
expressions than the dear picture can have. He
was with me last night, and he is here now. You
cannot see him, West, but I can."</p>

<p>"Mother," I said, "you talk as if you were ill.
Do you think you are ill?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, darling, just a little weak, but that soon
passes. There is nothing to be alarmed about,
Westenra. The fact of a person being thoroughly
happy does not surely mean that that person is in
danger."</p>

<p>"I am so glad you are happy," I said.</p>

<p>"I am wonderfully so; it is the glad presence of
God Himself, and also of your dear father. If I
have a wish in the world," continued mother then
slowly, and she looked at me as she spoke, "it is to
see James Randolph. I cannot imagine why he
does not write. He has been very good to me, and
I like him much. He is a dear fellow, full of courtesy
and chivalry; he has a gentle, tender, brave
heart; he would make the girl he loves happy, very
happy. I should like to see him again, and to
thank him."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span></p>

<p>I did not dare to tell mother what we all now
firmly believed with regard to Mr. Randolph. I
tried to thread my needle, but there was a mist
before my eyes. The needlework nearly fell from
my hand. Suddenly, in the midst of our conversation
in the quiet drawing-room, I heard a commotion.
Some one&mdash;two people were coming upstairs&mdash;the
steps of one were heavy, there was an altercation
in the landing, a voice pleaded with another
voice, and the strange voice got loud and angry.</p>

<p>I half rose from my seat, and then sat down
again.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked mother; "you look
very white, Westenra. Is there anything wrong?"</p>

<p>"I don't want strangers to come here just now,"
I said.</p>

<p>"But you forget, my dear child, that this is
everybody's drawing-room. This cosy corner is my
special seat, but we cannot possibly keep our boarders
out&mdash;it is impossible, my darling."</p>

<p>She had scarcely said the words before the
door burst open, and a man with red hair and red
whiskers, in a loud check suit, entered.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, "I thought as much; I thought
I'd get to headquarters if I came here. Now,
is this lady Mrs. Wickham, and is this young lady
Miss Wickham? Now, Miss Mullins, I will see
them for myself, please; you cannot keep me back;
I am determined to have my rights, and&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span></p>

<p>I rushed towards the door. One glance at
mother's face was enough. It had turned white,
the blue look came round her lips, there was a
startled gleam in her eyes.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she said, and she looked at Jane.</p>

<p>"Go to her, Jane; stay with her," I said; "I will
manage this man. Go to her, and stay with her."</p>

<p>Jane went to mother, and I rushed up to the
man.</p>

<p>"I am Miss Wickham," I said; "I know what
you want. Come with me into the next room."</p>

<p>He followed me, muttering and grumbling.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I see Mrs. Wickham&mdash;she is at
the head of this establishment? My name is Allthorp;
you are all heavily in my debt, and I want
to know the reason why I don't see the colour of my
money."</p>

<p>"Oh! please do not speak so loud," I implored.</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked. "I am not mealy-mouthed.
I want my money, and I am not afraid to ask for it."</p>

<p>"I tell you, you shall have your money, but do not
speak so loud. Mrs. Wickham is ill."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's a fine excuse. That's what Miss Mullins
tried to put me off with. Miss Mullins seems to be
a sort of frost, but I was determined either to see you
or Mrs. Wickham."</p>

<p>"I am Miss Wickham."</p>

<p>"And the house belongs to you? I can sue you
if I like for my money."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly you can, and I hope if you sue any one
it will be me. How much is owed to you?"</p>

<p>"Eighty-nine pounds, and I tell you what it is,
Miss Wickham. It's a shame when a man works
hard from early morning to late at night, a black
shame that he should not be paid what is due to
him. I'd like to know what right you have to take
my tea and my coffee, and to eat my preserved
fruits, and to make your table comfortable with my
groceries, when you never pay me one farthing."</p>

<p>"It is not right," I answered; "it is wrong, and
you shall be paid in full." I took a little note-book
and entered the amount.</p>

<p>"Give me your address," I said; "you shall be
paid."</p>

<p>He did so.</p>

<p>"I'll give you twenty-four hours," he said. "If at
the end of that time I do not receive my money in
<i>full</i>, yes, in <i>full</i>, mark you, I'll have a man in. I
hear it answered very well in the case of Pattens, and
it shall answer well in my case. So now you have
had my last word."</p>

<p>He left the room noisily and went downstairs. I
waited until I heard the hall-door slam behind him,
and then I went back to mother. She was leaning
back in her chair; her eyes were closed. I bent over
her and kissed her.</p>

<p>"What is it, West? What did that horrid man
want?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span></p>

<p>"He has gone, darling; he won't trouble us any
more."</p>

<p>"But I heard him say something about a <i>debt</i>. Is
he owed any money?"</p>

<p>"He was very troublesome because his account
was not paid quite as soon as he wished," I said; "but
that is nothing. He shall have a cheque immediately."</p>

<p>"But I do hope, dear Miss Mullins," said mother,
turning to her and looking at her fixedly, "that you
pay the tradespeople weekly. It is so much the best
plan."</p>

<p>"Quite so," she answered.</p>

<p>"This house is doing splendidly, is it not?" said
mother. "We shall make a fortune if we stay on
here long enough?"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite so," answered Miss Mullins.</p>

<p>I stole out of the room again. Mother looked
satisfied, and although her cheeks were a little too
bright in colour, I hoped no grave mischief was done.</p>

<p>I ran downstairs. It was nearly four o'clock. I
determined to wait in the hall or in the dining-room,
in case any more of those awful men&mdash;wolves, Albert
Fanning had called them&mdash;should arrive. Mother
must not be troubled: mother must not run such an
awful risk again. Just then I heard steps approaching,
and there was the sound of a latch-key in the hall
door. Most of our guests had latch-keys. I do not
know what I noticed in that sound, but I knew who
was there. I entered the hall. Mr. Fanning had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
come in. He did not expect to see me, and he started
when he saw my face. I had never cared for Mr. Fanning&mdash;never,
never. I had almost hated him rather
than otherwise; but at that moment I looked at him
as a deliverer. There was no one there, and I ran up
to him.</p>

<p>"Come into the dining-room," I said. "I must
speak to you," and I caught his hand. His great
hand closed round mine, and we went into the dining-room,
and I shut the door.</p>

<p>"One of them came," I said, "and&mdash;and nearly
killed mother, and I promised that he&mdash;that he should
be paid. His name is Allthorp. He has nearly killed
mother, and he nearly killed me, and&mdash;and will you
pay him, and will you pay the others?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean it?" said Albert Fanning. "Do
you mean it? Are you asking me to do this, clearly
understanding?"</p>

<p>"Clearly, clearly," I said.</p>

<p>"And may I kiss you, just to make the bond all
sure?"</p>

<p>"You may," I said faintly. He bent forward, and
I felt his kiss on my forehead.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />
<span class="s08">YOU ARE A GOOD MAN</span></h2>

<p>Within a week every debt was paid absolutely and
in full. Even the landlord was abundantly satisfied.
Jane Mullins lost her look of care, and became
cheerful and fat and good-tempered once more.
The boarders, who had been merry enough and careless
enough all through, suspecting nothing, of course,
seemed now to be beside themselves with merriment.
The weather was so fine and the house was so
pleasant. Jane Mullins quite came out of her shell.
She told stories of her early life, and made those
boarders who sat near her at dinner quite roar with
laughter, and Captain and Mrs. Furlong also came
out of their shells, and were most agreeable and kind
and chatty; and mother came down to dinner as
usual, and sat in the drawing-room as usual, and in
the evenings there was music, and I sang my songs
and played my pieces and wore my very prettiest
dresses, and Albert Fanning looked at me, and looked
at me, and Mrs. Fanning nodded approval at me.</p>

<p>Mrs. Armstrong, too, became strangely mysterious,
wreathing her face in smiles now and then, and now
and then looking strangely sour and disappointed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
and Marion Armstrong began to flirt with a young
German who had arrived. We never did want to
have foreigners in the establishment, but he offered
to pay a big sum for a certain room, and Jane said
it would be the worst policy to leave him out. He
satisfied Marion Armstrong too, which was another
thing to be considered, for Marion and her mother
were the sort of boarders who are always more or
less the backbone of a house like ours. They stay
on and on; they pay their money weekly. They
speak of their aristocratic neighbours, and are mostly
advertisements themselves.</p>

<p>Now that the German, Herr Tiegel, had come,
there was certainly very little chance of Mrs. and
Miss Armstrong taking their departure until the end
of the season.</p>

<p>Jane used to go and have long talks with mother,
and spoke about the future, and the extensions we
should make, and Albert and his mother too talked
about possible extensions. Mrs. Fanning whispered
darkly to me that Albert had large ideas now with
regard to the boarding-house.</p>

<p>"It's wonderful, my love, the interest he takes in
it," she said; "I never saw anything like it in the
whole course of my life, and for a publisher too!
But his idea is no less than this: When the lease of
the next house falls in, we take it too, and break
open doors, and have the two houses instead of one.
He says the two houses will pay, whereas the one
don't, and never could. The boarders, poor things!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
think that they are doing us a splendid good turn, but
this house ain't paying, and it never will, my love."</p>

<p>To these sort of remarks I never made any answer.
I was quite cheerful; I had to be cheerful for mother's
sake, and it was only at night I let myself go. Even
then I tried hard to sleep well and to shut away the
future.</p>

<p>Albert Fanning and I, by tacit consent, hardly
ever met alone, and that future life which we were
to lead together, when a year had expired, was not
spoken of between us. A fortnight, however, after
all the debts had been paid, and the house had been
put upon a very sure and very firm foundation once
more, Mrs. Fanning came softly to me where I was
sitting in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Do you mind going into the little room for a
moment," she said.</p>

<p>The little room was on the same floor, it was the
room where I had seen Althorp on that dreadful day
when I had bound myself in a bondage in many
ways worse than death.</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked, looking at her with frightened
eyes. She took my hand and patted it softly.</p>

<p>"You are a very good girl and a very brave one,"
she said, "and there's nothing Albert and I wouldn't
do for you. Albert wants to have a chat with you, he's
waiting in the other room; you go along, dear. Oh,
after the first blush you won't mind a bit; go, dear, go."</p>

<p>I looked at mother, who was talking with Mrs. Furlong.
The whole room was peaceful and quiet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
a good many of the boarders were out, for it was
now the height of the season and almost midsummer.
The windows were wide open. I caught mother's
eye for an instant; mother smiled at me. Of late
she used to wear a very far away look. There was
often an expression in her eyes which seemed to say
that she and father were holding converse. I caught
that glance now, and it steadied my own nerves,
and stilled the rebellion at my heart. I got up
steadily. Had my stepping down&mdash;oh, had my
stepping down led to this? It was a bitter thought,
and yet when I looked at mother, and felt that I
had saved her from intolerable anguish and perhaps
sudden death, I felt that it was worth while. I
went into the next room.</p>

<p>Albert Fanning, before our engagement&mdash;(oh yes,
of course, we were engaged, I must use the hated
word)&mdash;Albert before our engagement had thought
little or nothing of his dress, but now he was
extremely particular. An evening suit had been
made to fit his tall ungainly person by one of the
best tailors in the West End. He was wearing it
now, and his light flaxen hair was standing up
straighter than ever, and he had a kind of nervous
smile round his lips. When he saw me enter he
came forward and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "and how is Westenra? Sit
down, won't you?"</p>

<p>I did sit down; I sat where some of the summer
breeze coming in from across the Square garden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
could fan my hot cheeks. I sat down trembling.
He stood perfectly still an inch or two away from
me. He did not attempt to take my hand again.
After a pause, being surprised at his stillness, I
looked up at him; I saw his blue eyes fixed on my
face, with a very hungry expression. I sighed
heavily.</p>

<p>"Oh," I said, "you have been so very good, and I
have never even thanked you."</p>

<p>"You never have after, just the first day," he said;
"but I did not expect thanks. Thanks were not in
the bond, <i>you</i> were in the bond, you know. That is
all I want."</p>

<p>He sat down then near me, and we both must have
felt the same summer breeze blowing on our faces.</p>

<p>"I am picturing the time when the year is out,"
he said slowly, "when you and I are away together
in the country. I never cared much for the country,
nor for nature, nor for anything of that sort, but I
think I should like those things if you were with
me. You embody a great deal to me, you make
poetry for me. I never knew what poetry was
before. I never cared for anything but nonsense
rhymes and matters of that sort, until I met you,
but you make poetry and beauty for me and all the
best things of life. There is nothing I won't promise
to do for you when you come to me, and in the
meantime&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "in the meantime."</p>

<p>"If you are certain sure, Westenra, that you are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
going to keep your bond, why, I&mdash;I won't worry you
more than I can help just at present."</p>

<p>"Certain sure that I am going to keep my bond?
Yes, I am sure," I said. "Would I take your money
and, and deceive you? Would I have asked you to
save us and deceive you? No, no; you think I am
good. I am not specially good, but I am not so
low as that."</p>

<p>"Dear child," he said, and now he took my hand
and stroked it softly. He did not squeeze it, or draw
it near to him, but he laid it on one of his own huge
palms and kept on stroking it.</p>

<p>"The very prettiest little paw I ever saw in my
life," he said then; "it's wonderful how slim it is,
and how long, and how white, and what little taper
fingers; it's wonderful. I never saw anything like
it. You are a poem to me, that's just what you are,
Westenra, you are a poem to me, and you will make
a new man of me, and you will keep the bond, won't
you, dear?"</p>

<p>"I will," I said.</p>

<p>"I have put down the date," he said; "I put it
down in my note-book; I am going to keep it <i>always</i>
by me; it is writ in my heart too. I declare I am
getting poetical myself when I look at you. It's
writ in my heart in gold letters. It was the 18th
of May when you promised yourself to me, dear.
May is not a lucky month to marry in, so we will
marry on the first of June of next year. You'll
promise me that, won't you?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," I said.</p>

<p>"And in the meantime very likely you would
rather not have it known."</p>

<p>"It has been most kind and generous of you and
Mrs. Fanning not to speak of it," I answered.</p>

<p>"Just as you like about that; but I can see that,
with the care of your mother and one thing or
another you find me rather in the way, so I thought
I would tell you that I am going off, I am going to
Germany to begin with for a fortnight, and then I
shall take lodgings in town. Oh, the house at Highgate
won't hold me until it holds my little wife as
well, but I won't live in this house to be a worry to
you morning, noon, and night. And when I am not
always there perhaps you'll think of me, and how
faithful I am to you, and how truly, truly I love
you; and you will think, too, of what you are to me,
a poem, yes, that's the right word, a beautiful poem,
something holy, something that makes a new man
of me, the most lovely bit of a thing I ever saw.
Sèvres china is nothing to you. I have seen dainty
bits of art sold at Christy's before now, but there
never was anything daintier than you before in the
world, and I love you, there! I have said it. It
means a good deal when a man gives all his love to
a woman, and I give it all to you; and when everything
is said and done, Westenra, bonny as you are,
and lovely, and dainty as you are, you are only a
woman and I am only a man."</p>

<p>"I think," I said suddenly, and I found the tears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
coming into my eyes and stealing down my cheeks,
"that you are one of the best men I ever met. I
did not think it. I will tell you frankly that I used
to regard you as commonplace, and&mdash;as vulgar. I
saw nothing but the commonplace and the vulgar in
you, but now I do see something else, something
which is high, and generous, and even beautiful. I
know that you are a good man, a very good man. I
don't love you yet, but I will try; I will try at least
to like you, and on the first of June next year I will
be your wife."</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear," he replied, "you could not
have spoken clearer and plainer and more straight if
you were to study the matter for ever and ever.
Now I know where I am, and I am contented.
With your sweet little self to take pattern by, I
have not the slightest doubt that I'll win that
golden heart of yours yet. I mean to have a right
good try for it anyhow. The mater will be so pleased
when I tell her how nicely you spoke to me to-night.
I am off to Germany first thing in the morning; you
won't see me for a fortnight, and I won't write to you,
Westenra; you'd be worried by my letters, and I
cannot express what I feel except when you are there.
I won't even kiss you now, for I know you would
rather not, but perhaps I may kiss your hand."</p>

<p>He raised my hand to his lips; I did not look at
him, I slowly left the room. He was very good, and
I was very fortunate. Oh yes, although my heart
kept bleeding.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br />
<span class="s08">HAND IN HAND</span></h2>

<p>Mr. Fanning went away and Mrs. Fanning took
care of me. She openly did this; she made a
tremendous fuss about me, but she never by word
or deed alluded to my engagement to her son
Albert. She did not talk nearly so much as in
former times of her son; perhaps he had told her
that I was not to be worried, but she was very good
and very nice, and I got sincerely attached to her:
and I never saw the Duchess nor Lady Thesiger nor
my old friends, although I heard that the Duchess
was fairly well again, and was out and going into
society; and every one now seemed certain that
Jim Randolph had gone to the bottom in the <i>Star
of Hope</i>, but by universal consent the boarders
decided that the news should be kept from mother,
and mother grew much better. The weather was
so fine she was able to go out. We got a bath
chair for her and took her out every day; and the
boarding-house was thronged, absolutely thronged
with guests; and by Mrs. Fanning's suggestion Miss
Mullins put up the prices, and very considerably too,
for the London season, but the boarders paid what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
they were asked willingly, for the house was so sweet
and so bright and so comfortable; and Jane had her
moment of triumph when she saw that No. 14 in
the next street was beginning to imitate us, to put
up sun blinds, and even to fix balconies on to the
windows, and to have the same hours for meals;
and the ladies who kept No. 14 called one day and
asked to see Jane Mullins. Jane did give them a
spice of her mind, and sent them away without any
information whatever with regard to her plans.</p>

<p>"I could not tell them to their faces," said Jane
to me that day, "that it wasn't I. I am just a
homely body, and can only do the rough homely
work; I didn't tell them that it was because I had
a lady who had the face of an angel and the ways of
a queen in the drawing-room, and a young lady, the
princess, her daughter, that the boarding-house prospered.
I never let out to them that because you
two are real ladies, and know how to be courteous
and sympathetic and sweet, and yet to uphold your
own dignity through everything, that the place was
always full. No, I never told them that. What cheek
those Miss Simpsons had to try to pick my brains!"</p>

<p>Yes, undoubtedly, whether we were the cause or
not, things seemed to be flourishing, and mother
enjoyed her life; but one evening towards the end
of June she began to talk of old times, of the
Duchess, and the friends she knew in Mayfair, and
then quite quietly her conversation turned to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
subject ever I believe near her heart, James Randolph
and his friendship for her.</p>

<p>"He ought to be back now," she said. "I have
counted the months, and he ought to be in England
many weeks ago. I cannot understand his silence
and his absence."</p>

<p>I did not answer. Mother looked at me.</p>

<p>"He was fond of you, West," she said.</p>

<p>My heart gave a great throb and then stood still.
I bent my head, but did not reply.</p>

<p>"He never wished me to tell you," said mother.
"He felt, and I agreed with him, that it would be
best for him to speak to you himself. He said that
he would be back in England early in April at the
latest, and then he would speak to you. But he
gave me to understand that if for any reason his
return was delayed I might act on my own discretion,
and tell you what comforts me beyond all possible
words, and what may also cheer you, for I can scarcely
think, my darling, that the love of a man like that
would be unreturned by a girl like you, when once
you knew, Westenra, when once you surely knew.
Yes, he loves you with all his great heart, and when
he comes back you will tell him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh don't, mother," I interrupted, "oh don't say
any more."</p>

<p>My face, which had been flushed, felt white and
cold now, my heart after its one wild bound was
beating low and feebly in my breast.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it, West?" said mother.</p>

<p>"I would rather&mdash;&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"That he told you himself? Yes, yes, that I
understand. Whenever he comes, West, take your
mother's blessing with the gift of a good man's
heart. He has relieved my anxieties about you,
and his friendship has sweetened the end of a
pilgrimage full&mdash;oh, full to overflowing&mdash;of many
blessings."</p>

<p>Mother lay quite quiet after these last words, and
I did not dare to interrupt her, nor did I dare to
speak. After a time she said gently&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your father came to me again last night. He
sat down by me and held my hand. He looked
very happy, almost eager. He did not say much
about the life he now leads, but his eyes spoke
volumes. I think he will come back to-night. It
is quite as though we had resumed our old happy
life together."</p>

<p>Mother looked rather sleepy as she spoke, and I
bent down and kissed her, and sat with her for
some little time. I saw that she was in a sound
sleep, and her lips were breaking into smiles every
now and then. She had been so well lately that we
had sent Nurse Marion away, for her services seemed
to be no longer required.</p>

<p>After sitting with mother until nearly midnight I
went up to my own room. I sat down then and
faced the news that mother had given me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span></p>

<p>"I always knew it," I said to myself, "but I
would not put it into words before; I always guessed
it, and I was happy, although I scarcely knew why.
Yes, I have put it into words at last, but I must
never do so again, for on the 1st of June next year
I am to marry Albert Fanning, and he is a good
man, and he loves me."</p>

<p>I stayed awake all night, and early in the morning
went downstairs. I entered mother's room. I felt
anxious about her, and yet not anxious. The room
was very still, and very cool and fresh. The windows
were open and the blinds were up; mother
always liked to sleep so, and the lovely summer air
was filling the room, and there was a scent of heliotrope
and roses from the flowering plants on the
verandah. Mother herself was lying still as still
could be on her bed. Her eyes were shut, and one
of her dear white hands was lying outside the
coverlet. It was partly open, as though some one
had recently clasped it and then let it go.</p>

<p>I went up to the bedside and looked down at
mother. One glance at her face told me all. Some
one <i>had</i> clasped her hand, but he had not let it go.
Hand in hand my father and mother had gone away,
out through that open window, away and away, upward
where the stars are and the Golden Gates stand
open, and they had gone in together to the Land
where there is no Death.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br />
<span class="s08">TOO LATE</span></h2>

<p>On the evening of mother's funeral, I was sitting in
the little room. I had the little room quite to myself,
Jane had arranged that. I had gone through,
I thought, every phase of emotion, and I was not
feeling anything just then; I was sitting quiet, in a
sort of stupor. The days which had intervened
between mother's death and her funeral had been
packed full of events. People had come and gone.
Many kind words had been said to me. Mr. Fanning
had arrived, and had taken my hand once again
and kissed it, and looked with unutterable sorrow
into my eyes; and then, seeing that I could not bear
his presence, had gone away, and Mrs. Fanning had
opened her arms, and taken me to her heart, and
sobbed on my neck, but I could not shed a tear in
return; and Captain and Mrs. Furlong had been
more than kind, and more than good; and the
Duchess had arrived one morning and gone into the
room where mother lay (that is, what was left of
mother), and had sobbed, oh, so bitterly, holding
mother's cold hand, and kissing her cheek; and then
she had turned to me, and said&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span></p>

<p>"You must come home with me, Westenra, you
must come away from here, you are my charge now."</p>

<p>But I refused to leave mother, and I even said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You neglected her while she was alive, and now
you want to take me away from her, from the last I
shall ever see of her beloved face."</p>

<p>"I could not come; I did not dare to," said the
Duchess, "it was on account of Jim. I have been
grieving for Jim, and I thought I should have let
his death out to her; so I had to stay away, but my
heart was aching, and when I heard that she&mdash;that
she had gone&mdash;I"&mdash;and then the Duchess buried
her face in her hands, and sobbed, oh, so bitterly.
But I could not shed a tear.</p>

<p>The Duchess and the Duke both went to the
funeral, which made a great impression on all the
guests in the boarding-house; and Lady Thesiger
went; I saw her at a little distance, as I stood close
to mother's grave; but all these things were over,
and father and mother were together again. That
was my only comfort, and I sat in the little room,
and was glad that I could not suffer much more.</p>

<p>Into the midst of my meditations there came a
brisk voice, the door was opened suddenly, there was
a waft of fresh air, and Lady Thesiger stood near me.</p>

<p>"You are to come with me at once, Westenra," she
said, "the carriage is at the door, and Miss Mullins, and
that good soul, Mrs. Fanning, are packing your things.
You are to come right away from here to-night."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span></p>

<p>I did not want to go.</p>

<p>I said, "Please leave me, Jasmine, I cannot talk
to you now."</p>

<p>"You need not talk," said Jasmine Thesiger, "but
come you must."</p>

<p>I opposed her as best I could; but I was weak
and tired, and half stunned, and she was all life and
energy; and so it came to pass, that in less than an
hour, I found myself driving away in her luxurious
little brougham to her house in Mayfair. She gave
me a pretty room, and was very kind to me.</p>

<p>"I'll leave you alone, you know," she said; "I
don't want to worry you in any way, but you must
not stay at the boarding-house any longer. Your
mother is dead, and you must come back to your
own set."</p>

<p>"I can never come back to my own set," I answered;
"or rather, my set is no longer yours,
Jasmine; I have stepped down for ever."</p>

<p>"That is folly, and worse than folly," she
replied.</p>

<p>She came and sat with me constantly and talked.
She talked very well. She did her utmost, all that
woman could possibly do, to soothe my trouble, and
to draw me out, and be good to me; but I was in a
queer state, and I did not respond to any of her
caresses. I was quite dazed and stupid. After a
fortnight I came downstairs to meals just as usual,
and I tried to speak when I was spoken to, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
the cloud on my spirit never lifted for a single
moment.</p>

<p>It was now the middle of July, and Jasmine and
her husband were talking of their summer trip.
They would go away to Scotland, and they wanted
me to go with them. I said I would rather not, but
that fact did not seem to matter in the very least.
They wanted me to go; they had it all arranged.
I declared that I must go back to Jane to the boarding-house,
but they said that for the present I
belonged to them. I thought to myself with a dull
ache, which never rose to absolute pain, how soon
they would give me up, when they knew that I was
engaged to Albert Fanning. I had not mentioned
this fact yet, though it was on the tip of my tongue
often and often. Still I kept it to myself. No one
knew of our engagement but Jane Mullins, who, of
course, guessed it, and Mrs. Fanning and Albert himself.
I respected the Fannings very much for keeping
my secret so faithfully, and I respected them still
more for not coming to see me.</p>

<p>On a certain evening, I think it was the 15th of
July&mdash;I remember all the dates of that important
and most terrible time; oh, so well&mdash;I was alone in
Jasmine's drawing-room. Jasmine and her husband
had gone to the theatre; they had expressed regret
at leaving me, but I was glad, very glad, to be alone.
I sat behind one of the silk curtains, and looked with
a dull gaze out into the street. It was between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
eight and nine o'clock, and the first twilight was
over everything. I sat quite still, my hand lying on
my black dress, and my thoughts with mother and
father, and in a sort of way also with Mr. Fanning
and my future. I wished that I could shut away
my future, but I could not. I had done what I had
done almost for nothing. Mother's life had only
been prolonged a few weeks. My one comfort was,
that she had gone to her rest in peace, quite sure
with regard to my future, and quite happy about
me and my prospects. She was certain, which indeed
was the case, that I loved James Randolph, and
that whenever he returned, we would marry; and if
by any chance his return was delayed the boarding-house
was doing well, and my temporal needs were
provided for. Yes, she had all this comfort in her
dying moments, so I could scarcely regret what I
had done.</p>

<p>I sat on by the window, and thought vaguely of
mother, and not at all vaguely of Albert Fanning;
he was a good man, but to be his wife! my heart
failed me at the terrible thought.</p>

<p>Just then I heard the door of the room softly
open, and close as softly; there came a quick step
across the floor, a hand pushed aside my curtain,
and raising my eyes I saw James Randolph. He
looked just as I had seen him before he went away;
his eyes were full of that indescribable tenderness,
and yet suppressed fun, which they so often wore;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
his cheeks were bronzed, he had the alert look of a
man who had gone through life, and seen many
adventures. And yet with all that, he was just as he
always was. It seemed the most natural thing in the
world to have him close to me, and I scarcely changed
colour; and, after a moment's pause, said quietly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then you did not die, after all?"</p>

<p>"No," he replied. He spoke in a cheerful, matter-of-fact,
everyday voice.</p>

<p>"I was delayed," he said, "but I have come back
at last." Then he dropped into a chair near me.
"I went to 17 Graham Square," he said, "and they
said you were here. I did not ask a single question.
I came straight on here. Am I too late? Don't tell
me I am too late."</p>

<p>"Oh, you know it," I answered, "you must know
it, you are quite, quite too late&mdash;too late for everything,
for everything!"</p>

<p>There was a sob in my voice, but I would not
let it rise. I saw his brow darkening to a frown of
perplexity and alarm, and I turned my eyes away.
Had he interpreted a double meaning in my words?
Did he really even now guess that he was too late
for everything?</p>

<p>"Tell me about your mother," he said, in a
choking voice; "is she&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>He looked at me, and I pointed to my black dress.
He uttered a sharp exclamation of pain, and then
said slowly&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span></p>

<p>"I understand, Westenra, I am too late; but,
thank God, not too late for everything."</p>

<p>As he said this I think the bitterness of death
passed over me; for was he not now quite too late
for everything&mdash;for the love which I could have
given him, for the joy which we might both have
shared, had he only come back a little sooner. I
almost wished at that bitter moment that he had
never returned, that he had really died. The
next instant, however, a revulsion came over me,
and I found that I was glad, very glad, that he was
alive, that he was in the land of the living, that I
had a chance of seeing him from time to time.</p>

<p>"To-night," I said to myself, "I will not allow
anything to temper my joy. He has come back,
he is alive. No matter though I must never be
his wife, I am glad, glad to see him again."</p>

<p>"I will tell you all about what kept me," he continued,
for he half read my thoughts. "We were
wrecked, as of course you saw in the papers, off Port
Adelaide, and nearly every soul on board perished."</p>

<p>"But your name was not in the lists," I answered.</p>

<p>"That can be accounted for," he said, "by the
fact that I had only come on board a couple of
hours before at Adelaide, and doubtless the purser
had not time to enter my name. I had no intention
of taking passage in that special liner
until the morning of the day when the wreck
occurred. Well, the captain went down with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
ship, and only one woman, two children, myself, and
some of the sailors wore rescued. As the ship went
down I was struck by a spar on my head and badly
injured. When I was finally picked up I was quite
unconscious, and for six weeks and more I was in
hospital at Adelaide. As soon as ever I was well
enough I took the first boat home; and here I am,
Westenra, in time&mdash;oh, I hope in time&mdash;for the best
of all. But tell me, how have things been going?
I have been more anxious than I can say. There
must have been money difficulties. You can little
imagine what I went through. Can you bear just
to speak of your mother? And can you bear to
tell me how 17 Graham Square has been going?"</p>

<p>"We had hard times, but we pulled through," I
answered briefly.</p>

<p>"Did you?" he cried, with a sigh of relief; "what
a wonderful creature Jane Mullins is! What an
extraordinary head for business she possesses! I
must go and see her to-morrow, or&mdash;or to-night."</p>

<p>"Don't go to-night," I said, and I stretched out
my hand a very little and then drew it in again;
but he saw the gesture, and suddenly his strong
brown hand took mine and closed over it and held
it firmly.</p>

<p>"Then I am in time, in time for the best of all,"
he said, and he gave a sigh straight from the bottom
of his heart. "Now, I must tell you something.
Will you listen?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span></p>

<p>I drew my hand away, he dropped it, looked
at me with a hurt expression, and then went on
hurriedly, "I have got something to confess to you."</p>

<p>"I am listening," I said.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have guessed the truth. I have a
great deal to answer for. I cannot tell you how I
have reproached myself. I have always taken an
interest in you and in your mother. Even as a
schoolboy at Eton this has been the case."</p>

<p>"But why?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Did you never know&mdash;I hoped not, but your
mother knew, only I begged of her not to tell you&mdash;I
am the son of the man whose life your
father saved? His name was Chaloner then,
but with some property he changed it to the
one which I now bear, and I have been called
Randolph almost the whole of my life. When my
father died he gave me a charge. He said if ever
the time came when you or your mother were in
difficulties or peril or danger, I was to remember
what your gallant father had done for him. He
need not have told me, for the deed had always
excited my keenest admiration; but I never came
across you until that day when, by the merest
chance, I was at the house-agents when you came
in. I heard your name and I guessed who you
were, but I did not dare to look at you then. I
felt strangely overpowered.</p>

<p>"I went away, but I came back again shortly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
afterwards, and, forgive me, child, I overheard a
great deal of your scheme, and I remembered my
father's words and determined to help you. It was
I who sought Jane Mullins. Her people had been
old retainers of ours, and she had always worshipped
the ground on which I walked. I told her exactly
what I meant to do, and she helped me straight
through at once. The money which smoothed
matters with the landlord and enabled you to take
the house, was really my money, money which I had
inherited from my mother, but which was invested
in Australian stocks. At that time these stocks
were paying a high dividend, and everything seemed
to be going well; but you had not been three
months in the boarding-house before the bank in
Melbourne which held such a large amount of my
money went smash, and I was obliged to go
over to secure what was left. The blow was most
sudden, and I had no one to help me. I gave
Jane Mullins what little money I had left, and went
to Australia. I quite hoped I should be back before&mdash;before
any great trouble came to you. I rescued
a large portion of my money, and hoped that everything
was all right. Then came the shipwreck, the
danger, the awful fight with death in the hospital,
the final home-coming, and now&mdash;now I find that I
shall never see your mother again. What did she
think of my long absence, my enforced silence,
Westenra? What did she feel about me?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span></p>

<p>"She always hoped you would come back, and
she always loved you," I said slowly.</p>

<p>"Did she tell you nothing more?"</p>

<p>No colour could come to my face; my heart was
too cold, too bitterly cold, too despairing.</p>

<p>"She told me something more," I said in a whisper.
He bent close to me.</p>

<p>"That I love you, darling&mdash;that I have loved you
from the first moment I saw your face&mdash;that I love
your courage, and your dear, dear self? I am a
wealthy man now, Westenra. Money has come to
me while I have been away, and I am a wealthy
man and in your set, and&mdash;and will you come to me,
darling? Will you make me happy&mdash;will you? Oh!
I know you love me&mdash;I feel you do. You will come
to me?"</p>

<p>But I started up.</p>

<p>"I cannot," I said.</p>

<p>"You cannot! Then you do not love me?"</p>

<p>I made a great struggle. Never in the whole
course of my life did I make a struggle like that.
My struggle was to keep my lips closed; but I
looked wildly up at Jim, and Jim looked at me, and
the next moment, against my will, perhaps against
his will, I was in his arms, and my head was on his
breast.</p>

<p>"You love me; there is your answer," he said.
"You need not say any more. You have gone
through much. Oh! I am happy, and I will take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
such care of you, little West. I have loved you for
so long, and so deeply."</p>

<p>But I managed to wrest myself away.</p>

<p>"I cannot go to you," I said, "and I have never
said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must say it now," he answered. "You do
love me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I cannot marry you; it is too late. Oh!
you have been good, but there is nothing to be said;
it is too late. It is as much too late as if I were
dead&mdash;dead, as mother is dead. Oh! I can say no
more."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />
<span class="s08">THIS DEAR GIRL BELONGS TO US</span></h2>

<p>I forget all about the night that followed. I also
forget the next day. I think I stayed in my room
most of the time, but the day following I went down
to the drawing-room. London was already emptying
fast. Jim had not come back. I sat in the drawing-room
wondering what was going to happen, feeling
that something must happen soon&mdash;a great catastrophe&mdash;a
great shattering of that castle in the air
which I had built so proudly a few months ago.
While I was sitting there Jasmine bustled in.</p>

<p>"Now that is good, West," she said. "You are
better. I want to have a little chat with you."</p>

<p>I raised my eyes. I knew very well what she was
going to talk about, but I was not prepared to tell
the whole truth yet. There was one matter I kept in
reserve&mdash;my engagement to Albert Fanning. Whether
I did right or wrong, the announcement of that extreme
news could not pass my lips. I often struggled
to tell it, but never yet had I been able. I knew, of
course, that if Jim came to see me again I must tell
him everything, but I hoped in my mad misery that
he would not come again. Then the next hour I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
hoped the other way. I longed most passionately to
see him, and so I was torn from hour to hour and
from minute to minute with longings and doubts and
despairs; but all through everything, I kept my
secret untold within my breast.</p>

<p>"It is so nice about Jim Randolph," said Jasmine,
sitting down near me. "Do you know that when
Sir Henry Severn dies, Jim will be the successor to
the baronetcy. While Jim was away in Australia,
Sir Henry's son Theodore died quite suddenly. It
was awfully sad, and now James is the next in succession.
Sir Henry wishes him to live either with
him at Severn Towers, in Somersetshire, or to have
a house close by. James went down yesterday to see
the old man, and will probably be coming back to-morrow.
He was very sorry to leave you, but he
had to go. He will be a rich man in the future, for
Sir Henry Severn is very wealthy. It is a grand
chance for Jim. He never for a moment supposed
that the title would come to him."</p>

<p>I sat silent. I had a little ring on my finger&mdash;a
very plain ring, with one tiny diamond in it. It had
been given to me by Albert Fanning. I would not
allow him to give me a flashy or showy ring, as he
wanted to do, and I think he would gladly have
spent a couple of hundred pounds on my engagement-ring,
but I would not have it, not until the whole
thing was known, then he might lavish jewellery on
me as much as he pleased for all I cared. I twisted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
the little ring round and thought of my bond, and
said after a pause&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do grieve about one thing, and that is that
mother did not see Mr. Randolph before she died."</p>

<p>"But she always knew about everything. It is an
open secret," said Jasmine. "I cannot imagine,
Westenra, why you are so reserved with me. Every
one knows. The Duchess knows, your mother knew,
I know that James loves you, that he has loved you
for months and months. What else would have
taken a young man like James, a man of the world,
so polished, so distinguished, so charming, to live in
a place like Graham Square? Besides, dear, he has
told you himself, has he not?"</p>

<p>I felt myself turning white.</p>

<p>"He has told you, has he not?" repeated
Jasmine.</p>

<p>"I would rather not say," I replied.</p>

<p>"Your face tells me; besides, I saw the Duchess
yesterday, and she said that she was so happy, for
now you would be back again in your own set.
You will make a very pretty and graceful Lady
Severn."</p>

<p>"I care nothing whatever about that," I said,
and I jumped up and walked to the window. "I
hate titles," I continued. "I hate rank; I hate the
whole thing. It is humbug, Jasmine; humbug.
Why is it necessary for us all to class together in
Mayfair, or to live in large houses in the country, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
order to love each other? Why should we not go
on loving, whatever our worldly position? Oh! it is
cruel; the whole thing is cruel."</p>

<p>"But you ought to be rejoiced about James," continued
Jasmine, who did not evidently think it worth
her while even to answer my last words. "He has
come back; he is quite well. In a few years at
latest he will be Sir James Severn, for of course he
must take the name with the baronetcy, and you will
be his pretty wife. Doubtless he will want to marry
you very soon&mdash;as soon, I mean, darling, as you can
bring yourself to go to him after your dear mother's
death; but I knew your mother quite well enough,
Westenra, to be sure that the sooner you made yourself
happy the better pleased she would be, and you
will be happy with such a good man. Why, he is a
catch in a thousand. I cannot tell you how many
girls are in love with him, and I never saw him talk
to any one or flirt the least bit in the world except
with your charming self. You are lucky, Westenra;
very lucky."</p>

<p>I went now and stood by the window, and as I
stood there I felt my heart give a great thump, and
then go low down in my breast. I turned impulsively.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I am not quite well," I began; but then I
hastily thought that I must see it out. The moment
had come when Jasmine Thesiger was to have all her
doubts answered, her questions replied to, and my
future would be clear in her eyes, for I had seen the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
chocolate-coloured brougham draw up at the door,
and Mrs. and Mr. Fanning get out.</p>

<p>"What is the matter? Are you ill?" said Jasmine.</p>

<p>"No, no; I am quite well," I replied. I sank down
on a chair. "I only saw some visitors just arrive," I
continued.</p>

<p>"Visitors at this hour! I will tell Tomkins we
are not at home."</p>

<p>"It is too late," I answered; "they are coming up.
They are friends of mine."</p>

<p>"All right, child; but how queer you look," Jasmine
gazed at me in great astonishment.</p>

<p>I hoped earnestly that I did not show my emotion
too plainly, when the next moment the door was
thrown open by Lady Thesiger's smart servant, and
Mrs. and Mr. Fanning walked in.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fanning had put on black on my account.
She had told me that she meant to go into mourning,
as we were practically relations already. I
had begged of her not, but she had not regarded
my wishes in the least. She was in a heavy black
serge dress, and a voluminous cape which came down
nearly to her knees, and she had a black bonnet on,
and her face was all beaming and twinkling with
affection and sympathy and suppressed happiness.
And Albert Fanning, also in a most melancholy suit
of black, with his hair as upright as ever, came up
to my side. I heard his usual formula&mdash;</p>

<p>"How is Westenra?" and then I found myself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
introducing him and his mother to Lady Thesiger,
and Lady Thesiger gave a haughty little bow, and
then sat down, with her eyes very bright, to watch
events. Perhaps already she had an inkling of what
was about to follow.</p>

<p>"We have come," said Mrs. Fanning, looking at
her son and then glancing at me, "to tell you,
Westenra, that we think you had better arrange to
spend your holidays with us. Considering all things,
it seems most fitting."</p>

<p>"What I say is this," interrupted Albert Fanning.
"Westenra must do as she pleases. If she likes to
come with us to Switzerland we shall be, I need not
say, charmed; but if she prefers to stay with her
ladyship"&mdash;here he gave a profound bow in the
direction of Lady Thesiger&mdash;"we must submit. It
is not in the bond, you know, mother, and anything
outside the bond I for one debar."</p>

<p>"You always were so queer, my son Albert," said
Mrs. Fanning, who had lost her shyness, and now
was determined to speak out her mind fully.</p>

<p>"It's this way, your ladyship," she continued,
turning to Lady Thesiger. "I may as well be plain,
and I may as well out with the truth. This pretty
young girl, this dear girl, belongs to us. She does
not belong to you&mdash;she belongs to us."</p>

<p>"No, no, mother; you are wrong there," cried Mr.
Fanning; "she does not belong to us at present."</p>

<p>"It's all the same," said Mrs. Fanning; "don't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
talk nonsense to me. When a girl is engaged to a
man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Engaged! Good heavens!" I heard Lady
Thesiger mutter, and then she sat very still, and
fixed her eyes for a moment on my face, with a
sort of glance which seemed to say, "Are you quite
absolutely mad?"</p>

<p>"Yes, engaged," continued Mrs. Fanning. "It is
a very queer engagement, it seems to me, but it is a
<i>bonâ fide</i> one for all that."</p>

<p>"As <i>bonâ fide</i>," said Mr. Fanning, with a profound
sigh, "as there is a sky in the heavens. As
<i>bonâ fide</i> as there is a day and a night; as <i>bonâ
fide</i> as that I am in existence; but the marriage
is not to be consummated until the 1st of June
of next year. That is in the bond, and we have
nothing to complain of if&mdash;if Westenra"&mdash;here
his voice dropped to a sound of absolute tenderness&mdash;"if
Westenra would rather not come with us
now."</p>

<p>"Please explain," said Lady Thesiger. "I knew
nothing of this. Do you mean to tell me, madam,
that my friend Westenra Wickham is engaged to&mdash;to
whom?"</p>

<p>"To my son Albert," said Mrs. Fanning, with
great emphasis and with quite as much pride as
Lady Thesiger's own.</p>

<p>"Is that the case, Westenra?" continued Jasmine,
looking at me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span></p>

<p>I bowed my head. I was silent for a moment;
then I said, "I am engaged to Albert Fanning. I
mean to marry him on the 1st of June next year."</p>

<p>"Then, of course, I have nothing to say. Do
you wish to go away with the Fannings, Westenra?
You must do what you wish."</p>

<p>I looked at her and then I looked at Mrs. Fanning,
and then I looked at Albert, whose blue eyes
were fixed on my face with all the soul he possessed
shining out of them. He came close to me, took
my hand, and patted it.</p>

<p>"You must do just as you please, little girl," he
said; "just exactly as you please."</p>

<p>"Then I will write and let you know," I answered.
"I cannot tell you to-day."</p>

<p>"That is all right&mdash;that is coming to business,"
said Mrs. Fanning; "that is as it should be.
Albert, we are not wanted here, and we'll go.
You'll let us know to-morrow, my dearie dear.
Don't keep us waiting long, for we have to order
rooms in advance at the big hotels in Switzerland
at this time of year. Your ladyship, we will be wishing
you good morning, and please understand one
thing, that though we may not be quite so stylish,
nor quite so up in the world as you are, yet we have
got money enough, money enough to give us everything
that money can buy, and Westenra will have
a right good time with my son Albert and me.
Come, Albert."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span></p>

<p>Albert Fanning gave me a piteous glance, but I
could not reply to it just then, and I let them both go
away, and felt myself a wretch for being so cold to
them, and for their society so thoroughly.</p>

<p>When they were gone, and the sound of wheels
had died away in the street, Jasmine turned to me.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" she cried. "It cannot
be true&mdash;you, Westenra, engaged to that man! Jim
Randolph wants you; he loves you with all his heart;
he has been chivalrous about you; he is a splendid
fellow, and he is rich and in your own set, and you
choose that man!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I choose Albert Fanning," I said. "I can
never marry James Randolph."</p>

<p>"But why, why, why?" asked Jasmine.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX<br />
<span class="s08">HAVE I LOST YOU?</span></h2>

<p>I told her everything, not then, but on the evening
of the same day. She came into my room where I
was lying on a sofa, for I was thoroughly prostrated
with grief for my mother and&mdash;and other great
troubles, and she held my hand and I told her.
I described Jane's anxiety in the boarding-house,
the debts creeping up and up, the aspect of affairs
getting more and more serious; I told her about
Mrs. Fanning and Albert, and the chocolate-coloured
brougham, and the drive to Highgate, and the
rooms all furnished according to Albert's taste, and
the garden, and the proposal he made to me there,
and my horror. And then I told her about mother's
gradual fading and the certainty that she would not
live long, and the doctor's verdict, and the one
caution impressed and impressed upon me&mdash;that
she was to have no shock of any sort, that everything
was to be made smooth and right for her.</p>

<p>I described, further, Jane Mullins' agitation, her
despair, her difficulty in going on at all, the dreadful
news which had reached us with regard to Jim,
the almost certainty that he was drowned.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span></p>

<p>Then I told her of the awful day when I went to
try and borrow a thousand pounds from the Duchess,
and how I could not see the Duchess, for she was
too ill to see any one, all on account of Jim's supposed
death; and then I told her what I found
when I came back&mdash;the awful greasy little man in
the dining-room&mdash;the man in possession. I described
his attitude that day at dinner, and the surprise
and astonishment of the boarders; and then
I explained how he had gone and why he had gone,
and I told her of my visit to Albert Fanning in
Paternoster Row, and what Albert Fanning had
said, and how kind he was to me; and, notwithstanding
his want of polish, how really chivalrous
he was in his own way, and how really he loved me
and wanted to help me. I made the very best of
him, and I went on still further, and told her of
the man who had burst into mother's presence in
the drawing-room, and rudely demanded payment
for his debt, and then how I had yielded, and told
Albert Fanning that I would marry him, and how,
after that, everything was smooth, and all the
worries about money had disappeared as if by
magic.</p>

<p>"I gave him my bond," I said at the conclusion.
"I said that I would marry him at the end of a
year, and he was satisfied, quite satisfied, and he
paid up everything, and mother went to her grave
happy. She was sure that all was well with me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
and indeed I gave her to understand that all was
very well, and she died; and never guessed that
17 Graham Square was an absolute, absolute failure&mdash;a
castle in the clouds, which was tumbling about
our heads."</p>

<p>I paused at the end of my story. Jasmine had
tears in her eyes; they were rolling down her
cheeks.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come to me, Westenra?" she
said; "my husband is very rich, and we would
have lent you the money. Oh! to think that a
thousand pounds could have saved you!"</p>

<p>"I did not think of you," I replied. "You must
acknowledge, Jasmine, that you were cold and
indifferent, and did not help me with a cheery
word, nor with much of your presence, during my
time in the boarding-house; and when the Duchess
failed me, troubles came on too thick and fast to
wait for any chance help from outside. I just
took the help that was near, and in my way was
grateful."</p>

<p>"I see," said Jasmine; "it is a most piteous&mdash;most
terrible story."</p>

<p>"Do not say that," I answered. "Help me to bear
it; don't pity me too much. Help me to see the
best, all the best in those two good people with
whom I am in future to live. Albert Fanning is
not polished, he is not a gentleman outwardly, but
he has&mdash;O Jasmine! he has in his own way a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
gentleman's heart, and his mother is a dear old
soul, and even for Jim I would not break my bond,
no, not for fifty Jim Randolphs; but I love Jim&mdash;oh,
I love him with all my heart and soul."</p>

<p>I did not cry as I said the words; I was quite
past tears that evening, and Jasmine continued to
sit near me and to talk in soft tones, and after a
time she relapsed into silence, a sort of despairing
silence, and I lay with my eyes closed, for I could
not look at her, and presently I dropped asleep.</p>

<p>At an early hour the next day I wrote to the
Fannings to tell them that I would go with them
to Switzerland. I went and saw Jasmine after I
had written the note.</p>

<p>"I am going with the Fannings to Switzerland
on the 4th of August," I said; "will this interfere
with your plans? I mean, may I stay on here
until they start?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you can stay on here, Westenra," she
replied. She looked at me fixedly. I thought she
would say something to dissuade me, but she did
not. She opened her lips once, but no words
came. She simply said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is that the letter?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I am going out," she said then; "I will post it
for you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," I answered. I went back to the
drawing-room. I heard Jasmine go downstairs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
and out, and then I sat quiet. Everything seemed
to have come to a sort of end; I could not see my
way any further. In a fortnight's time I should
have truly stepped down out of sight of those who
were my friends. I should have left them for ever
and ever. It would be a final stepping down for
me. Nevertheless, the faintest thought of being
unfaithful to the promise I had made, I am glad
to think now, never for a single moment occurred
to me.</p>

<p>Jasmine returned to lunch, and after lunch we
went to the drawing-room, and she asked me if I
would like to drive with her. I said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, but not in the Park." Perhaps she guessed
what I meant.</p>

<p>"Jim has come back," she remarked; "I had a line
from him, and he wants to see you this evening."</p>

<p>"Oh, I cannot see him," I answered.</p>

<p>"I think you must. You ought to tell him yourself;
it is only fair to him. Tell him just what you
told me; he ought to know, and it will pain him
less to hear it from your lips."</p>

<p>I thought for a moment.</p>

<p>"What hour is he coming?" I asked then.</p>

<p>"He will look in after dinner about nine o'clock.
I am going to a reception with Henry; you will
have the drawing-room to yourselves."</p>

<p>I did not reply. She looked at me, then she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have written already to tell him that he can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
come. It is absolutely necessary, Westenra, that
you should go through this; it will be, I know, most
painful to you both, but it is only just to him."</p>

<p>Still I did not answer. After a time she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do not wish to dissuade you; indeed, I cannot
myself see how you can get out of this most mistaken
engagement, for the man has behaved well, and I
am the first to acknowledge that; but has it ever
occurred to you that you do a man an absolute
and terrible injustice when you marry him, loving
with all your heart and soul another man? Do
you think it is fair to him? Don't you think he
ought at least to know this?"</p>

<p>"I am sure Albert Fanning ought not to know
it," I replied, "and I earnestly hope no one will
ever tell him. By the time I marry him I shall
have"&mdash;my lips trembled, I said the words with
an effort&mdash;"I shall have got over this, at least to a
great extent; and oh! he must not know. Yes,
I will see Jim to-night, for I agree with you
that it is necessary that I should tell him myself,
but not again," I continued; "you won't ask me to
see him again after to-night?"</p>

<p>"You had much better not," she replied; she
looked at me very gravely, and then she went away.
Poor Jasmine, she was too restless to stay much
with me. She was, I could see, terribly hurt, but
she had not been gone an hour before the Duchess
came bustling in. She was very motherly and very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
good, and she reminded me of my own dear mother.
She sat near me, and began to talk. She had heard
the whole story. She was terribly shocked, she could
not make it out. She could not bring herself to
realise that her god-daughter was going to marry a
man like Albert Fanning.</p>

<p>"You ought never to have done it, West, never,
never," she kept repeating.</p>

<p>At last I interrupted her.</p>

<p>"There is another side to this question," I said;
"you think I did something mean and shabby when
I promised to marry a man like Albert Fanning.
You think I have done something unworthy of your
god-daughter, but don't you really, really believe
that you would have a much poorer, more contemptible,
more worthless sort of god-daughter if she
were now to break her bond to the man who saved
her mother at considerable expense&mdash;the man who
was so good, so kind, so faithful? Would you really
counsel me to break my bond?"</p>

<p>"No, I would not," said the Duchess, "but I would
do one thing, I would up and tell that man the
truth. I would put the thing before him and let
him decide. Upon my word, that's a very good
idea. That's what I would do, Westenra."</p>

<p>"I will not tell him," I replied. "I have promised
to marry him on the 1st of June next year.
He knows well that I do not love him, but I will
keep my bond."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span></p>

<p>"That is all very fine," said the Duchess. "You
may have told him that you do not love him, but
you have not told him that you love another man."</p>

<p>"I have certainly not told him that."</p>

<p>"Then you are unfair to him, and also unfair to
James Randolph. You think nothing at all of
breaking his heart."</p>

<p>"He was away when he might have helped me,"
I replied. "That was, I know, through no fault of
his, but I cannot say any more except that I will
not break my bond."</p>

<p>The Duchess went away, and in the evening Jim
arrived. He came in with that very quiet manner
which he always wore, that absolute self-possession
which I do not think under any circumstances would
desert him, but I read the anxiety in his grey eyes,
the quizzical, half-laughing glance was gone altogether,
the eyes were very grave and almost stern.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "I have come to say very plain
words. I want to know why you will not marry
me."</p>

<p>"Have you not heard?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I have heard nothing," he answered. "I have
been given no reason; you just told me you could
not marry me the other night, and you were so upset
and shaken that I did not press the matter any
further. You know, of course, that I can give you
everything now that the heart of girl could desire."</p>

<p>"Do not talk of those things," I said. "I would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
marry you if you had only a hundred a year; I
would marry you if you had nothing a year,
provided we could earn our living together. O
Jim! I love you so much, I love you so much, so
much."</p>

<p>I covered my face with my hands, a deep, dry sob
came from my throat.</p>

<p>"Then if that is so," he answered, half bending
towards me and yet restraining himself, "why will
you not marry me?"</p>

<p>"I cannot, because&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take your own time," he said then; "don't speak
in a hurry. If you love me as you say you love me,
and if you know that I love you, and if you know
also, which I think you do, that your mother wished
it, and all your friends wish it, why should not we two
spend our lives together, shoulder to shoulder, dear,
in the thick of the fight, all our lives close together
until death does us part? And even death does not
really part those who love, Westenra, so we shall in
reality never be parted if we do so sincerely love.
Why should not these things be?"</p>

<p>"Because I am bound to another man," I said then.</p>

<p>He started away, a stern look came into his face.</p>

<p>"Say that again," was his answer, after a full
minute of dead silence.</p>

<p>"I am engaged to another," I said faintly.</p>

<p>"And yet you have dared to say that you love me?"</p>

<p>"It is true."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span></p>

<p>"In that case you do not love the man to whom
you have given your promise?"</p>

<p>"I do not."</p>

<p>"But what does this mean? This puzzles me."</p>

<p>He put up his hand to his forehead as if to push
away a weight. He was standing up, and the pallor
of his face frightened me.</p>

<p>"I do not understand," he said. "I had put
you on a pedestal&mdash;are you going to prove yourself
common clay after all? but it is impossible. Who
is the other man?"</p>

<p>Then I told him.</p>

<p>He uttered a sharp exclamation, then turned on
his heel and walked away to the window. He stood
there looking out, and I looked at him as his figure
was silhouetted against the sky.</p>

<p>After a time he turned sharply round and came
back to me and sat down. He did not sit close to
me as he had done before, but he spoke quietly, as
if he were trying to keep himself in control.</p>

<p>"This is very sudden and terrible," he said; "very
inexplicable too. I suppose you will explain?"</p>

<p>"I will," I said. "I knew you were coming to-night;
I was cowardly enough to wish that you
would not come, but I will explain."</p>

<p>"You are engaged to the man I used to see you
talking to at 17 Graham Square?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said; "do not speak against him."</p>

<p>"I would not be so cruel," he answered. "If you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
have promised yourself to him, he must merit some
respect; tell me the story."</p>

<p>So I told Jim just the same story I had told
Jasmine that morning. I did not use quite the
same words, for he did not take it so calmly. I
had never seen his self-possession shaken before.
As my story drew to an end he had quite a bowed
look, almost like an old man; then he said slowly&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was my fault; I should not have gone away.
To think that you were subjected to this, and that
there was no escape."</p>

<p>"There was no escape," I said. "Could I have
done otherwise?"</p>

<p>"God knows, child, I cannot say."</p>

<p>"I could not," I replied slowly. "If you had
been me you would have acted as I have done;
there are times when one must forget one's self."</p>

<p>"There are, truly," he said.</p>

<p>"Then you are not dreadfully angry with me,
Jim?"</p>

<p>"Angry?" he said slowly; "angry? You have
not given me the worst pain of all, you have not
stepped down from your pedestal, you are still the
one woman for me. But oh! Westenra, have I lost
you? Have I lost you?"</p>

<p>He bowed his head in his hands.

<h2>CHAPTER XXX<br />
<span class="s08">THE DUCHESS HAS HER SAY</span></h2>

<p>I shall never forget as long as I live that sultry
1st of August; there seemed to be scarcely a breath
of air anywhere, all the air of London had that used-up
feeling which those who live in it all the year
round know so well. It was hot weather, hot in
the house, hot in the outside streets, hot in the
burnt-up parks, hot everywhere. The sky seemed
to radiate heat, and the earth seemed to embrace it;
and we poor human beings who were subjected to it
scarcely knew what to do with ourselves.</p>

<p>Even in Jasmine's luxurious house, where all the
appliances of comfort were abundantly in evidence,
even there we gasped and thought of the country with
a longing equal to that of thirsty people for water.</p>

<p>Jasmine and her husband were going away the
next day, and the Duchess was going away too, and
I was to join the Fannings on the 4th. I was to
have three more days in Jasmine's house, and then
I was to go, I knew well never to return. I had
not seen Jim after that night, nearly a fortnight ago,
when I had told him everything, and from that hour
to now nothing at all had occurred to deliver me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
from my bondage and misery. Mrs. Fanning had
come twice to see me; she was very bustling and
self-important, and told me honestly that she had a
downright hatred for that airified madam her ladyship.
She said that we'd have an excellent time in
Switzerland, going to the very best hotels, enjoying
ourselves everywhere.</p>

<p>"And you two young engaged creatures will have
no end of opportunities for flirtation," she said; "I
won't be much in the way. You may be quite sure
that the old mother will efface herself in order to
give her son and her dear new daughter every
possible opportunity for enjoying life. Ah! my
dear, there is no time like the engaged period&mdash;the
man makes such a fuss about you then. He don't
afterwards, dear; I may as well be frank, but he
don't&mdash;the best of 'em even take you as if you
were common clay; but beforehand you're something
of an angel, and they treat you according.
It's the way of all men, dear, it is the way of every
single one of 'em. Now Albert, for instance, I
declare at times I scarcely know him. He used to
be a matter-of-fact sort of body, but he is changed
in all sorts of ways; and as to the way he speaks of
you, you'd think you weren't common clay at all,
that your feet had never yet touched the earth.
He drives me past patience almost at times; but I
say to myself, 'Thank goodness, it won't last.' That's
my one consolation, for I cannot bear those high-falutin'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
ideas, although there's nothing Albert does
that seems really wrong to me. He said to me
only yesterday, 'Mother, I have a kind of awe over
me when I am with her; she is not like any one
else, she is so dainty, and so&mdash;&mdash;' I declare I
almost laughed in his face; but there, I didn't, and
doubtless he has told you those sort of things himself.
I don't want to see you blush. Not that you
do blush, Westenra; I must say you take things
pretty cool. I suppose it is breeding. They say it
takes a power of good breeding to get that calm
which it strikes me you have to perfection. I never
saw any one else with it except that Mr. Randolph,
who, I hear, wasn't drowned at all, but came back
as safe as ever a few days ago. Well, well, I'm off
now. You wouldn't like to come back to the Métropole
to me and Albert the day her ladyship goes,
would you, child? Say out frankly if you have a
wish that way."</p>

<p>"No," I answered, "I have not a wish that way.
I will meet you at Victoria Station. I would rather
stay here until then."</p>

<p>"Well, well, good-bye, my dearie," said the stout
old woman, and she embraced me with her voluminous
arms, and patted me on my cheek.</p>

<p>But although she came, as I said, twice, Albert
did not come at all, and I thought it extremely nice
of him. New proofs of his kindness were meeting
me at every turn. He wrote to me several times,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
and in each letter said that he knew perfectly well
that I meant to be free until the year was up, and
that he was not going to worry me with overmuch
love-making, or any nonsense of that sort; but he
thought I would like Switzerland, and the change
would do me good, and although he would not say
much, and would not even ask me to go out walking
with him unless I wished it, yet I was to be
certain of one thing, that he was ready to lay down
his life for me, and that I was the one thought of
his heart, the one treasure of his soul.</p>

<p>"Poor Albert!" I had almost said, "Poor dear
Albert!" when I read that last letter. How much
he had developed since the days when we first
met. It is wonderful what a power love has, how
it ennobles and purifies and sanctifies, and raises,
and Albert's love was very unselfish&mdash;how utterly
unselfish, I was to know before long.</p>

<p>But the days went on, and each day seemed a
little harder than the last, until I became quite
anxious for the complete break to take place when
I should have parted with my old friends and my
old life for ever. But I knew quite well that even
if I did go away, the image of the man I really
loved would remain in my heart. As this was
likely to be a sin by-and-by&mdash;for surely I ought not
to marry one man and love another&mdash;I must try to
fight against all thoughts of Jim, and to banish the
one who would not be banished from my thoughts.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span></p>

<p>I have said that the 1st of August came in with
tremendous heat; every window in the house was
open, the blinds were all down. Jasmine was quite
fretful and irritable. She pined for Scotland; she
said that she could scarcely contain herself until she
got away.</p>

<p>She and her husband were to go early the next
day to the North, and all arrangements were being
made, and the final packing was being completed.</p>

<p>The Duchess also was kept in town owing to some
special duties, but on the next day she was also to go.</p>

<p>She had asked me two or three times to visit
her, but I had written to her begging of her not to
press it.</p>

<p>"I must go through with what I have promised,"
I said, "and to see you only pains me. Do forgive
me. Perhaps you will see me once when I return
from Switzerland just to say good-bye."</p>

<p>The Duchess had taken no notice of this letter,
and I concluded sadly that I was never to see her
or hear of her again; but as I was sitting by myself
in Jasmine's inner drawing-room on that same 1st
of August, about twelve o'clock in the morning, I
was startled when the door was thrown open, and
the dear Duchess came in. She came up to me,
put her arms round me, drew me to her breast, and
kissed me several times. She had not, after all,
more motherly arms than Mrs. Fanning, but she
had a different way about her, and before I knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
what I was doing, the feel of those arms, and the
warm, consoling touch of her sympathy, caused me
to burst out crying. Mrs. Fanning would not have
thought much of the calm which in her opinion
seems to accompany good breeding had she seen
me at that moment. But the Duchess knew exactly
what to do. She did not speak until I was quieter,
and then she made me lie on the sofa, and took my
hand and patted it.</p>

<p>"I am thinking of you, Westenra, almost all day
long," she said solemnly. "I am terribly concerned
about you. Have you got a photograph of that man
anywhere near?"</p>

<p>"I have not got one," I replied.</p>

<p>"He never sent you his photograph? I thought
they always did."</p>

<p>"He would have liked to. He is very patient,
and he is very fond of me, you need not be anxious
about me, it is just&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it is the giving of you up, child, that is so
painful, and the want of necessity of the whole thing.
Sometimes I declare I am so impatient with&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But what the Duchess meant to say was never
finished, for the drawing-room door was opened once
more and the footman announced Mr. Fanning.</p>

<p>Albert Fanning entered in his usual, half assured,
half nervous style. He had a way of walking on
his toes, so that his tall figure seemed to undulate
up and down as he approached you. He carried his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
hat in his hand, and his hair was as upright as usual,
his face white, his blue eyes hungry. He was so
anxious to see me, and this visit meant so much to
him, that he did not even notice the Duchess. He
came straight up to me, and when he saw that my
cheeks were pale and my eyes red from recent crying,
he was so concerned that he stooped, and before
I could prevent him gave me the lightest and softest
of kisses on my cheek.</p>

<p>"I could not keep away," he said, "and I&mdash;I have
a message from the mater. Can you listen?"</p>

<p>I was sitting up, my face was crimson, with an
involuntary movement I had tried to brush away
that offending kiss. He saw me do it, and his face
went whiter than ever.</p>

<p>"Introduce me, Westenra," said the voice of the
Duchess.</p>

<p>In my emotion at seeing Albert Fanning, I had
forgotten her, but now I stood up and made the
necessary introduction. Her Grace of Wilmot gave
a distant bow, which Mr. Fanning gravely and with
no trace of awkwardness returned.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?" said the Duchess then;
"do you know I have been most anxious to see
you?"</p>

<p>"Indeed," he replied. He looked amazed and a
little incredulous. He kept glancing from the
Duchess to me. I do not know why, but I suddenly
began to feel intensely nervous. There was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
a gleam in my old friend's soft brown eyes which I
had only seen there at moments of intense emotion.
She evidently was making up her mind to say something
terrible. I exclaimed hastily&mdash;</p>

<p>"Albert, if you wish to speak to me, will you
come into the next room. You will excuse us for
a moment will you not, Duchess?"</p>

<p>"No, Westenra," she replied, and she rose now
herself; "I will not excuse you. You must stay
here, and so must Mr. Fanning, for I have got
something I wish particularly to say to Mr.
Fanning."</p>

<p>"Oh, what?" I cried. "Oh, you will not"&mdash;she
held up her hand to stop my torrent of words.</p>

<p>"The opportunity has come which I have desired,"
she said, "and I am not going to neglect it. It
need make no difference to either of you, but at
least you, Mr. Fanning, will not marry my dear girl
without knowing how things really are."</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't speak of it, I implore you, you
don't know what terrible mischief you will do."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, Westenra. Mr. Fanning, this
young girl is very dear to me, I have known her
since her birth; I stood sponsor for her when she
was a baby. I take shame to myself for having
to a certain extent neglected her, and also her
mother, my most dear friend, during the few months
they lived in 17 Graham Square. I take shame to
myself, for had I done all that I might have done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
for those whom I sincerely loved, the calamity which
came about need never have occurred."</p>

<p>"As to that," said Albert Fanning, speaking for
the first time, and in quite his usual assured voice,
"it could not help occurring, your Grace, for the
simple fact that the boarding-house never could have
paid, the expenses were greater than the incomings.
If you have ever studied political economy, your
Grace will know for yourself that when you spend
more than you receive it spells <span class="smcap">RUIN</span>."</p>

<p>The Duchess stopped speaking when Albert
Fanning began, and looked at him with considerable
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Then you knew from the first that the extraordinary
scheme of my young friend could not succeed."</p>

<p>"I did," he replied, "and I bided my time. I
suppose you mean to say something disagreeable to
me; you do not think I am in the running with her
at all, but as far as that goes I have money, and she
has not any, and I love her as I suppose woman
never was loved before, and I will make her happy
in my own fashion. And I'll never intrude on her
grand friends, so that her grand friends can come to
see her as often as they like; and as to my mother,
she is a right-down good sort, though she wasn't
born in the purple like yourself, your Grace; so, as far
as I am concerned, I do not know what you have to
say to me. I suppose you want to tell me that
Westenra here, my pretty little girl, who is going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
to give herself to me on the 1st of June next year,
does not care for me, but she will care for me by-and-by,
for my feeling is that love like mine must
be returned in the long run, and if after a year she
don't tell your Grace that she is the happiest little
wife in the length and breadth of England, I shall
be greatly surprised."</p>

<p>Here Albert Fanning slapped his thigh in his
excitement, and then stood bolt upright before the
Duchess, who in absolute astonishment stared back
at him.</p>

<p>"That is not the point," she said. "You do
not want to marry a girl who not only does not love
you, but who does, with all her heart and soul, love
some one else?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course not," he replied, and a frightened
look came for the first time into his blue eyes. He
turned and faced me.</p>

<p>"Of course not," he repeated, his eyes still devouring
mine; "but Westenra cares for nobody, I
never saw a girl less of a flirt in the whole course of
my life. It is not to be supposed that such a very
pretty girl should not have men fall in love with
her, but that is neither here nor there."</p>

<p>"You ask her yourself," said the Duchess; "I
think from your face that you seem a very honest
good sort of man; you are a publisher, are you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Madam, I publish books, bright, entertaining
books too."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span></p>

<p>"I repeat that you seem a very honest upright
sort of man, who sincerely loves my young friend,
and honestly wishes to do his best for her, but I
think you will find that there is more behind the
scenes than you are aware of, and, in short, that
Westenra ought to tell you the truth. Tell him
the truth now, Westenra."</p>

<p>"Yes, tell me now, Westenra," he said; "tell me
the truth;" and he faced me once more, and I forced
myself to look into his eyes.</p>

<p>"I know you don't love me just yet," he continued,
"but it will come some day."</p>

<p>"I will do my very best to love you," I answered;
"I will try to be a good wife to you, Albert."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay&mdash;how sweetly you say those words.
May I hold your hand?"</p>

<p>I gave him my hand&mdash;he held it as he always
did hold it, as if it were something very precious
and sacred, letting it lie in his palm, and looking
down at it as if it were a sort of white wonder to him.</p>

<p>"But ask her the question," said her Grace, and
then I glanced at the Duchess and saw that her
cheeks were pink with excitement, and her eyes
shining; "ask her that straight, straight question
on which all your happiness depends, Mr. Fanning."</p>

<p>"I will, your Grace. You do not love me, Westenra,
but you will try to be a good wife to me,
and you will try to love me, that is, in the future.
There is no one else whom you love now, is there?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
I know, of course, what your reply will be, darling,
and it is a hard question to ask of you, as though I
doubted you. There is no one, is there, Westenra?
Speak, little girl, don't be afraid, there is no one?"</p>

<p>"But there is," I faltered. I covered my face for
a moment, then I checked back my tears and looked
at him as steadily as he had looked at me.</p>

<p>"There is another," he repeated, "and you&mdash;you
love him? Who is he?"</p>

<p>"I won't tell you his name. I shall get over it.
I could not help myself&mdash;I promised to marry you,
but I never said that I could love you, for I don't&mdash;not
now at least, and there is another, but I
will never see him again. It won't make any
difference to you, Albert."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it will," he said, "all the difference
on earth." He dropped my hand as though it hurt
him. He turned and faced the Duchess.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are talking of Mr. Randolph.
I quite understand, he belongs to the set in which
she was born, but he deserted her when she wanted
him most. It can scarcely be that she cares for
him. There, I don't want either of you to tell me
his name just now. I have heard enough for the
present."</p>

<p>He strode out of the room, slamming the door
behind him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI<br />
<span class="s08">THE END CROWNS ALL</span></h2>

<p>"I have done it now," said the Duchess, "God
knows what will be the consequence, but I have at
least delivered my soul."</p>

<p>She had scarcely uttered the words before Albert
Fanning strode back into the room. He was not
the least awkward now, he looked quite manly and
dignified.</p>

<p>"Will you oblige me," he said, looking straight
at the Duchess, "by giving me the address of Mr.
James Randolph?"</p>

<p>"You are not going to do anything," I cried,
springing up, "oh, you are not going to say anything?
This has been forced out of me, and I have
not mentioned any one's name."</p>

<p>"I will do nothing to hurt you, dear," he said very
gently, and he looked at me again, and putting his
hand on mine forced me quietly back into my seat.
Then he turned to the Duchess, waiting for her to
give him what he required.</p>

<p>Her face was very white, and her lips tremulous.
She tore a sheet out of her little gold-mounted note-book,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
which always hung at her side, scribbled a few
words on it, and handed it to him.</p>

<p>"I am dreadfully sorry to hurt you, you must
believe that," she said.</p>

<p>He did not make any response. He bowed to her
and then left the room.</p>

<p>"What does it mean? This is terrible," I cried.</p>

<p>The Duchess looked at me.</p>

<p>"Will you come home with me, Westenra? it is
best for you," she said. "Come and spend the rest of
the day with me."</p>

<p>"No, I cannot," I answered; "I must stay here.
Albert may come back again. There is no saying
what mischief you have done. I cannot think, I am
too miserable, too anxious. Oh, suppose he goes to
see Mr. Randolph, and suppose, suppose he tells him."</p>

<p>"I believe in his heart that man is a gentleman.
Even if you marry him I shall not be quite so
unhappy as I would have been," was the Duchess's
next speech, and then seeing that I was not inclined
to say anything more she left the room.</p>

<p>I do not know how the rest of the day passed.
From the quiet of despair my mind was suddenly
roused to a perfect whirl of anxiety, and I could not
think consecutively. I could plan nothing, I could
hope nothing, but it seemed to me that my journey
to Switzerland was indefinitely postponed, and that
my future from being settled in every detail, month,
week, hour, and all, was as indefinite and vague and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
shadowy as though I were standing on the brink of
the other world.</p>

<p>Jasmine entered the room at tea-time and asked
me what was the matter. I replied that I had nothing
at all fresh to tell her, for I felt that she must never
know what the Duchess had told Albert Fanning. She
gazed at me as I spoke as though I were a source of
irritation to her, and then said that my stepping down
had changed me so absolutely that she was not sure
whether I was a nice girl any longer, and whether,
after all, the fate of being Albert Fanning's wife was
not the best fate for me. Then I said stoutly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Albert Fanning is one of the best men in the
world, and I am fortunate to be left in such good
care." Jasmine got really angry and offended then,
and went out of the room. She presently came back
to ask me, if I would mind dining alone, as she and
Henry wished to spend their last evening with some
friends. I said that, of course, I did not mind. In
reality I was very glad.</p>

<p>Jasmine went out, and I was again alone. How
I hated the house; how I hated the dreary, and yet
beautifully-furnished drawing-room; how the heat
oppressed me, and seemed to take away the remainder
of my strength! I wondered if it were true, that I
was only two-and-twenty, just on the verge of womanhood.
I felt quite old, and I stretched out my arms,
and gave a dreary sigh; and felt that the sadness of
youth was just as <i>great</i> as the sadness of age; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
that one of its most painful moments was the knowledge
that, in the ordinary course of life, I was so far
from the end. Yes, I was young, and I must bear
my burden, and I was strong too; and there was no
chance under any ordinary circumstances of my not
living out the full measure of my years.</p>

<p>Just before dinner the drawing-room door was
again opened, and Albert Fanning for the third time
that day made his appearance. He looked quite
brisk, and bright, and like his usual self, except that
in some extraordinary way his awkwardness and self-consciousness
had completely left him; he was
evidently absorbed with some business on hand,
which made him a new man for the time.</p>

<p>"Will you come for a walk with me, Westenra?"
he asked gravely.</p>

<p>"What, now?" I inquired in some surprise and
trepidation.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, "or, at least, I want you to
drive with me now, and to walk with me afterwards.
I have a great desire that we should spend this
evening together; and I fancy, somehow, that you
won't deny me. I have a carriage outside; I bought
it for you, yesterday, a smart little victoria. I will
drive you to Richmond, and we can dine there.
You will come, won't you, dear?"</p>

<p>I paused to think, then I said, just as gravely as
he had addressed me&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll come."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span></p>

<p>"That is nice," he remarked, rubbing his hands,
"we'll have a good time, little girl. We won't mind
what the Duchess said; we'll have a right, good, jolly
time, you and I."</p>

<p>"Of course," I answered. I went up to my room,
dressed, and came down again.</p>

<p>"I am ready now," I said.</p>

<p>He took my hand.</p>

<p>"It is very good of you, Westenra; we shall have
a delightful evening; all that thundery feeling has
gone out of the air, everything is crisp and fresh,
and you'll enjoy your drive."</p>

<p>None of the servants saw us go out, and it was
Albert himself who put me into the victoria. He
sat beside me, took the reins, and we were off.</p>

<p>"Don't you think this is a neat little turn-out?"
he said, as we drove down in the soft summer air
to Richmond.</p>

<p>I praised the victoria to his heart's content, and
then I told him that I thought his taste was much
improved.</p>

<p>"It is all owing to you, dear," he replied. "You
like things to look <i>gentle</i> somehow. I could not
see myself looking at you in a place with <i>loud</i> things.
It was only this morning I was saying to myself, early
this morning, I mean"&mdash;he gave a quick sigh as he
uttered these last words&mdash;"I was saying to myself,
that we would furnish the house at Highgate over
again according to your ideas. We would just leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
a couple of rooms for mother, according to her tastes,
and you and I should have the rest of the house
furnished as you like. Liberty, Morris, all the rest,
everything soft, and cloudy, and dim, and you walking
about in the midst of the pretty things, and I
coming home, and&mdash;but, never mind, dear, only I
would like you always to feel, that there is nothing
under the sun I would not do for you, nothing."</p>

<p>"You are very, very kind," I murmured.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is not real kindness," he replied with great
earnestness. "You must not speak of it as kindness;
you cannot call it that, when you love, and
I love you so much, little girl, that when I do
things for you, I do things for myself; you can
never call it just <i>kindness</i> when you please yourself.
That is how I feel about the matter. You understand,
don't you?"</p>

<p>I nodded. I understood very well. Albert thought
me kind when I said gentle and affectionate words to
him, but he thought himself rather selfish than otherwise,
when he poured out his whole heart at my feet.</p>

<p>As we were driving quickly in the direction of
Richmond, he told me many of his plans. I had never
heard him speak more freely nor unrestrainedly.
Amongst other things he mentioned Jane Mullins.</p>

<p>"She is a capital woman," he said, "and she and
I have gone carefully into the matter of the house
in Graham Square. Jane wants to give it up, and
it is quite too big for her to manage alone. I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
starting her in a little boarding-house in Pimlico, and
with her business-like instincts she will do uncommonly
well there. She spoke of you when I saw her
yesterday, there were tears in her eyes."</p>

<p>"She must come and see us when we are settled
at Highgate," I replied, but to this remark of mine
he made no answer.</p>

<p>We got to Richmond, and had some dinner, and
then we went out, and walked up and down on the
terrace outside the hotel. There was a lovely view,
and the stars were coming out. Albert said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let us turn down this walk. It is quite sheltered
and rather lonely, and at the farther end there is an
arbour, they call it the 'Lover's Arbour.' Beyond
doubt many lovers have sat there; you and I, Westenra,
will sit there to-night."</p>

<p>I had been feeling almost happy in his society&mdash;I
had almost forgotten the Duchess, and even Jim
Randolph had been put into the background of my
thoughts; but when Albert proposed that he and I
should sit in the "Lover's Arbour" as lovers, I felt
a shiver run through me. I said not a word, however,
and I do not think he noticed the momentary
unwillingness which made me pause and hesitate.
We walked between the beautiful flowering shrubs,
and under the leafy trees to the little arbour, and
we entered. I seated myself; he stood in the
doorway.</p>

<p>"Won't you come and sit down, too?" I said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you ask me?" he answered, a light leaping
into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do ask you," I replied after a moment.</p>

<p>He sat down&mdash;then suddenly without the slightest
warning, his arms were round me; he had strained
me to his heart; he had kissed me several times on
my lips.</p>

<p>"Oh, you ought not," I could not help exclaiming.</p>

<p>"But why not?" he cried, and he did not let me
go, but looked into my eyes, almost fiercely it seemed
to me. "You are my promised wife, may I not kiss
you just once?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know, you have the right to kiss me, but
you have always been&mdash;&mdash;" I could not finish the
words. He suddenly dropped his arms, moved away
from me, and stood up. His face was gloomy, then
the gloom seemed to clear as by a great effort.</p>

<p>"I have kissed you," he said; "I vowed I would,
and I have done it. I shall remember that kiss, and
the feel of you in my arms, all my life long; but
I am not going to think of my own feelings, I have
something far more important to say. Do you
know, little girl, that I received an awful shock
to-day? Now, listen. You gave me your bond, did
you not?"</p>

<p>"I did, Albert, I did."</p>

<p>"Just come out here, dear, I want to see your face.
Ah! the moon shines on it and lights it up; there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
never was a face in all the world like yours, never to
me; and I vowed, that because of it, and because of
you, I would lead a good life, a beautiful life. A
great deal, that I did not think was in me, has been
awakened since you were good to me, Westenra."</p>

<p>"You have been very kind to me, Albert," I said,
"and I will marry you. I will marry you when a
year is up."</p>

<p>"You are a good girl," he said, patting my hand;
but he did not squeeze it, nor even take it in his.
"You are a very good girl, and you remember your
bond. It was faithfully given, was it not?"</p>

<p>"Very faithfully, Albert."</p>

<p>"And you always, always meant to keep it?"</p>

<p>"I always did. I will keep it. Albert, why do you
question me? Why do you doubt me?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you in a minute, darling. Now I want
to ask you a question. Do you love me the least
little scrap? Look well, well into your heart before
you answer. I know that when you said you would
marry me, you did not love me. You were willing
to be bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh; my
dear, dear wife, till death us did part; you were
willing to be all that?"</p>

<p>"I was," I said.</p>

<p>"And yet had you <i>never</i> a kindly feeling towards
me?"</p>

<p>"A very kindly feeling," I answered, "very kindly,
but I&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span></p>

<p>"I know," he said, "you are a good girl. I won't
press you too hard. Still my questions are not quite
over. Had you, Westenra, at the time you promised
yourself to me, any sort of idea that you cared for
another?"</p>

<p>"He was dead, or at least, I thought he was dead,"
I said, trembling, and turning away. "Had I thought
him alive, even for mother's sake, I could not have
done it, but I thought him dead."</p>

<p>"And now that he has come back, you are sorry
you gave me that bond?"</p>

<p>"Do not question me," I replied; "I will do my
best for you; you will never regret that you have
taken me to be your wife, but you must not question
me."</p>

<p>"Because of your sore, sore heart," he said, looking
very kindly at me; and now I looked back at him,
and saw that in some wonderful way the expression
on his face had changed; the look of passion had
left it&mdash;it was quite quiet, a very kindly face, a very
good face; never were there more honest blue eyes.</p>

<p>"I pressed you hard," he said, "I should not have
done it, I see it all now, and you were so good and
so unselfish. You gave me that bond for your
mother's sake. I meant to put you into a corner;
I meant to force your hand. It was unfair, miserably
unfair. I did not think so at the time, but now
I see it. Well, my dear, you are so gentle, and so
different from other girls, that you have opened my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
eyes. There is a good bit of pain in having one's
eyes opened sometimes, but there is also great joy
in giving perfect joy to one whom you love, as I
love you. So, if you will promise, little girl, faithfully,
that never, never shall those debts which I
paid for you, be paid back again to me; if you will
allow me, for the whole of my life, to feel that I was
the one who saved Westenra in her hour of bitter
need; I was the one who helped her mother in her
last moments to go down to the grave in peace, if
you will promise all that, Westenra, there is an end
of everything else. You have your bond back again.
I don't want it, child, it is yours to do what you will
with. You are free, Westenra. If it is hard on
me, I am not going to talk of myself; but, I hope,
I am manly enough to bear a bit of pain, and not
cause the girl I love best on earth to suffer pain to
her dying day. You are free, Westenra, that is all."</p>

<p>"But I won't be free," I answered passionately, for
at that moment all the heroism in me, all that my
dead father had given me before I was born, all
that I owed to him, sprang to life in my veins, and
I saw Albert Fanning as a hero, and faintly, very
faintly, I began to love him in return. Not for a
moment with the love I had for Jim, but still with
a love which might have made me a blessed if not a
happy wife.</p>

<p>"I won't be free, Albert," I cried, "I gave you my
bond, and I will keep it; I will marry you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind about that just now," he said; "but
do you think&mdash;" he sat down near me as he spoke,
and looked me in the face. "Do you think you
could bring yourself to do one last thing for me?"</p>

<p>"It won't be a last thing," I answered, "it will be
the first of many; I will do everything for you; I
will marry you."</p>

<p>"It is not such a big thing as that," he replied;
"but it is a big thing, at least a very big thing to
me. It is something that I shall prize all my life.
I took you in my arms just now and kissed you&mdash;will
you kiss me just once of your own accord?"</p>

<p>I did not hesitate; I raised my lips and pressed a
kiss on his cheek. He looked at me very mournfully
and quietly.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, "I shall always have this
to make a better man of me."</p>

<p>"But I am going to be yours; you won't cast me
off," I pleaded; "I said I would marry you on the
1st of June next year, and I will."</p>

<p>"But I would rather not, my little girl. The fact
is this, Westenra, I would not marry you now at any
price. I would have married you had I thought I
could have won you in the end, but I won't have a
wife who loves another. I could not do it on any
terms, Westenra. I am low down enough, but I am
not as low as that. So I refuse you, dear; I give
you up&mdash;you understand, don't you?"</p>

<p>I did understand. A wild wave of joy, almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
intolerable, surged round my heart, and the next
moment Mr. Fanning took my hand and led me out
of the arbour just where the moon was shining.</p>

<p>"I asked Mr. Randolph to come down," he said
quietly, "I guessed that perhaps he would be wanted.
I think this is he."</p>

<p>Footsteps were heard approaching, and Jim Randolph
stood in the moonlit path.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Randolph?" said Albert
Fanning, with that new dignity which self-denial
gave him. He looked almost grand at the moment.</p>

<p>"I have just been telling this young girl, Mr.
Randolph, that I have heard a certain secret about
her which she was bravely trying to keep to herself,
and in consequence of that secret I can have nothing
more to do with her. She wanted to marry me,
sir, but I have refused her; she is quite free, free for
any one else to woo and win. She is a very good
girl, sir, and&mdash;but that is all, I have nothing more to
say. I have given her back her bond." And then
without a word, Albert Fanning walked quickly away
through the gloom of the shrubbery, and Jim and I
found ourselves alone face to face with the moonlight
shining on us both.</p>
